The company carries a number of ranges that are available in the UK, and all products are also available for export and private label.\u00a0\u00a0With a team of seven staff based in Ilford, AmiRose London Ltd import and distribute beauty skincare cosmetics. As well as developing its own unique brands, the company also distribute other labelled brands, and over the years has supplied major supermarkets such as Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose and cosmetic outlets such as Boots, Superdrug, Holland & Barrett, Lloyds, plus pharmacies nationwide.\u00a0\u00a0In such a crowded marketplace, AmiRose London Ltd work hard to make its products stand out, and Jack commented, \u201cas a smaller company, we know that we have to be a little different, and more niche. From the outset, we aimed to specialise in developing products that customers could not find elsewhere.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the first items that AmiRose London Ltd developed was eye pads that actually looked and smelled like real cucumber slices. Many other companies were offering eye pads to soothe tired eyes, but AmiRose made its product stand out from the rest by including a cucumber fragrance & printed image that the customer could enjoy upon opening the box. This, in addition to the unique and unusual appearance of the pads ensured that the company had its own place in the cosmetic sector.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These proved so popular with clients, that AmiRose London Ltd continued to develop such products in different ways. The company expanded this idea, and as well as the eye pads, these unique products have been developed into face masks too. If required, masks and pads can have bespoke logos added to them including company branding or pictures to make them especially distinctive.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to this, the fragrance infused pads and masks have continued to develop, and customers can purchase products that smell of Watermelon, Green Tea or even Oranges among other things, It is these innovations that have ensure AmiRose London Ltd remain leaders in innovation\u00a0\u00a0It is not just skincare that you get from Amirose, it is spotting a gap in the market that people are looking for and we found that Snoring is a major problem in over 70% relationships. We have recently developed a nasal dilater snore-relief product called Snore Stop. Made from medical grade silicone and with strategically placed magnets to help keep the device in place, this is very simple to use. Once inserted the airways are much clearer, and each dilator comes with a hygienic carry case for storage or travel, and every box gives a 28-day supply.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, AmiRose London Ltd has been producing more products for the men\u2019s hair and skin care market, including products for thinning hair. These are fibres that when shaken or sprayed on will immediately cover a thin or bald spot on the head. This will remain in place until washed out - results have to be seen to be believed.\u00a0\u00a0As it looks to the future, the company is developing a range of biodegradable hair clips and brushes. Understanding that both the company and its customers are looking for more sustainable products, AmiRose London Ltd is launching these new products soon and is hoping for them to slot into the market very successfully.\u00a0In conclusion, Jack mentioned, \u201calthough COVID-19 was a tough time, we battled through it thanks to improving our online presence, and we spent time developing new products. We hope that customers will benefit from these as we move into the future.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0For more information:\u00a0\u00a0T 020 8559 8244jack@amirose.comwww.amirose.com", "Image": "", "PhoneNumber": "", "SortOrder": "1", "Title": "High quality skincare products and accessories\u00a0", "WebsiteURL": "http://www.amirose.com"}, {"CellType": "HeaderCell", "CompanyName": "AmiroseLondon__.jpg", "Date": "21/09/2022", "Description": "", "DetailDescription": "", "Image": "", "PhoneNumber": "", "SortOrder": "1", "Title": "", "WebsiteURL": "http://"}], "Menu 1 Industrial": [{"CellType": "HeaderCell", "CompanyName": " Impact Air Systems ", "Date": "21/09/2022", "Description": "The hot topic of plastics recycling is not going away any time soon, and rightly so", "DetailDescription": "The hot topic of plastics recycling is not going away any time soon, and\nrightly so.
