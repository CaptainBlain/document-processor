# document-processor

2018

I had to regulary update an app from a list of documents, I wrote this document processor to extract all the data that was needed and then pass it back in JSON format.

This is the file structure that had to be processed

The processor runs through each folder, then runs through each subfolder (if there is one) and gathers all the required data from the word documents.
