Graves1, Nigel Monk2* Corresponding author – s.mcmaster@pillarhouse.co.uk1 Functional Materials and Chemistry Research Group, Research Centre for\nManufacturing and Materials, Institute of Clean Growth and Future Mobility,\nCoventry University, Priory Street, Coventry CV1 5FB, U.K.2 Pillarhouse International Ltd., Rodney Way, Chelmsford, CM1 3BY, U.K.Introduction\nSelective soldering utilises a nozzle to apply solder to components on the\nunderside of printed circuit boards (PCBs). This nozzle can be moved to\neither perform dips (depositing solder to a single component) or draws\n(applying solder to several components in a single movement). The selective\nsoldering methodology thereby allows the process to be tailored to specific\njoints and allows multiple nozzle types to be used if required on the\ncircuit board.Key attributes of nozzles\nTo ensure that controlled application of the solder is maintained, the\nsolder must wet to the nozzle. Wettability is the study of the adhesion of\nliquids to solids due to the interaction between the surface energy of the\nsolid and the surface tension of the liquid. The most common method of\nmeasuring wettability is determining the contact angle of a sessile\ndroplet.When in contact with a solid, a liquid droplet will deform and spread out.\nThe amount of spreading and the angle of the interface between the liquid\nand solid is determined by the surface tension of the liquid and the\nsurface energy of the solid. Figure 1 demonstrates scenarios with various\nlevels of wetting. When the surface energy of the solid is greater than the\nsurface tension of the liquid, the droplet will have a lower contact angle.\nFigure 1(a) and (b) are an example of this.Figure 1. Examples of different contact angles between a droplet (stripped\nred) and solid (blue): (a) Contact angle of 0° demonstrating perfect\nwetting. (b) Contact angle less than 90°for a wetting surface. (c) Contact\nangle greater than 90° hydrophobic surface. By Idris.abk - Own work, CC BY-\nSA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=97191171For the wetting of the solder to the tip of the nozzle maintains a stable\nradial wave and achieves control during the soldering process by\nmaintaining a stable dome shape to deposit solder. Figure 2 shows a well\nwetted nozzle wherein the solder is adhered to the entire outer surface of\nthe nozzle. This allows for good control during the selective soldering\nprocess. The static wettability for this nozzle would be akin to Figure 1\n(a) or (b).Figure 2. A wetted nozzle.In the case of a material that solder does not readily wet to, the solder\nwill maintain a single stream as shown in Figure 3. The static wettability\nof this nozzle would produce a large contact angle such as in Figure 1 (c).Figure 3. A non-wetting nozzle.To achieve wetting between liquid solder and a nozzle, there must be a\nclean interface. Flux is used to remove oxides and generate/maintain this\nclean interface before and during operation. After cleaning, a chemical\nreaction between the solder and nozzle determines the extent of the wetting\nbut this interaction also causes wear of the nozzle.Therefore, a good nozzle must have good wettability to solder ensuring that\ncontrol can be maintained during the selective soldering process in\naddition to a balance between the wear and wetting.The need for development\nThe new nozzle will reduce operation and maintenance costs for\nmanufacturers by reducing the number of nozzles required overall and\nreducing downtime caused by nozzle failure. Improving the wettability of\nnozzles will allow for more challenging joints to be tackled using the\nselective method. This project has been undertaken due to customer requests\nto increase nozzle lifetime and reduce the maintenance required.This research project, part funded by Innovate UK and Pillarhouse\nInternational Ltd. is partnered with Coventry University through a\nknowledge transfer partnership scheme. The new AP Master Nozzle will be\navailable in June of 2023.T +44 (0)1245 491333\nsales@pillarhouse.co.uk\nwww.pillarhouse.co.uk\n",

          "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Business and Industry Today, we are pleased to announce Cornerstone Systems Ltd as our Monitoring & Control Systems Company of the Month.Cornerstone Systems Ltd was originally established in 1987 by Gareth Hughes and Peter Mason. In 2012 Richard Priestley and Liam Redmond became shareholding Directors after working for the business for many years. When Gareth and Peter retired in 2015, Richard and Liam took co-ownership of the business and proceeded to develop many new products.“Cornerstone has been around for over 35 years and some of the systems still in operation were installed in the 90s and are still serviced by us regularly. However, we have a host of new products and our new touchscreen units bring 21st century technology and features to our reliable and robustly designed products. Intelligent use of locally-generated power by our control systems has the potential to save the customer a significant percentage of their electricity cost from providers by maximising the use of the power that their on-site electricity generation equipment can produce,” stated Richard.As specialists in Temperature Monitoring and Control, Cornerstone offers the complete package from design, installation, and commissioning to long-term servicing packages. Richard expanded, “Predominantly, we work in the agricultural food sector, with potato and grain storage being the two main areas. We also have monitoring and reporting systems for biomass, wood pellet, and woodchip storage as well as compost process monitoring systems.”For the agriculture industry, Cornerstone manufacture temperature and humidity monitoring and control systems that are specifically designed for bulk vegetables such as potatoes, carrots and grain storage. Its wireless systems offer unparalleled safety, accuracy and reliability in stacked box and loose product stores.What’s more, the fact that all products are completely their own makes Cornerstone unrivalled. From the design through to the build, installation and servicing, every aspect of the hardware and software are designed in house in the UK. “This gives us a greater degree of flexibility and customisation to precisely meet our customers’ requirements. Our intelligent algorithms allow for monitoring and intelligent use of energy, including the monitoring and proactive use of power generated on-site, ie. solar or turbine generated power,” added Richard.Furthermore, Cornerstone has wireless and wired solutions that offer complete flexibility as well as the capabilities to provide monitoring and control for large outdoor sites and indoor facilities to clients who work with all forms of biomass. “We have many years of experience in providing systems for the biomass storage industry and our systems and probes are designed to fit the environment found on such sites. Our quality probes can be manufactured to various lengths and can have up to four accurate temperature measuring points,” stated Richard.Cornerstone also has a large amount of experience and expertise in the composting industry. Its very own Heat Sense system for composting is designed to read many sensors over a wide area, both wired and wireless with a primary function to provide documentary evidence of the sterilisation of a composting process. The software then provides a report showing what temperature the compost has been over a particular amount of time, and the levels to which it has not dropped below. The system caters to the client’s preference and parameters can be set to suit specific composting process requirements.“We pride ourselves on our customer service and offer each of our customers a personal approach that ascertains their requirements and devise a proposal to suit their needs. We aim to provide the best customer service in our small sector, with no customer being too small. We strive to continually further develop our products through innovation and customer feedback, with reliability and robustness remaining our key design factors.

          "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Sustainability Today, we are pleased to announce STADLER as our Industrial Machinery Manufacturing Company of the Month.STADLER is one of the leading global manufacturers of materials sorting facilities for the waste management industry. Headquartered in Germany, STADLER is a 7th generation, family business that has successfully transformed into one of the most well-respected environmental, high-technology companies within the recycling industry. Countries around the world have benefitted from STADLER’s high-quality machines and expertise, and in 2007 STADLER UK was set up as a project delivery and operational management company for the UK market.“At STADLER UK our priority is the assembly of automated sorting systems with a main focus to solve and manage the UK waste problem through functioning recycling streams. Materials that our plants process are plastic bottles, municipal solid waste, dry mixed recyclables, commercial waste, paper and cardboard, mixed construction materials and bulky waste, and many more,” stated Benjamin Eule, Director STADLER UK.Contributing towards the 400+ STADLER sorting plants around the world that feed the global recycling loop, STADLER UK has recently designed and built a new processing plant for Hywel NMP Ltd. in Wales, that is unique in its capacity to treat fines below 50mm, achieving exceptionally high recovery rates with a process that has a remarkably high yield for producing Solid Recovered Fuel.Benjamin commented, “we have a close-knit collaboration with Hywel NMP Ltd. and have worked with them on previous projects. We understood the particular material they wanted to process and we were able to advise them on certain processes. The main objective was to generate a high-quality fuel that is highly efficient and therefore saves resources as the residue of the material is minimalised and diverts high amounts of material away from disposal. We installed energy efficient motors so that the energy used in the processes was as low as possible.”The continues rise of fuel prices and a focus on saving natural resources is driving growth in the demand for Solid Recovered Fuel. This demand goes in line with reducing the amount of waste going to landfill. STADLER UK hope the industry will recognise its expertise, and that its collaboration with Hywel NMP Ltd. will create a ripple effect for further work within the UK, and for more opportunities to continue its R&D processes.STADLER has also recently released two new products; STADLER Label Remover and the New STADLER PX Conveyor. Both products fall in line with the company’s overall commitment to produce sustainable ways to maximise the efficiency of the recycling process and quality of output. The STADLER Label Removers are a valuable asset for plastic bottle sorting plants, where they can significantly increase the output and purity rates. The new STADLER PX acceleration conveyor integrates the best features of the BB and DB conveyors, for optical sensor sorting and takes purity to new heights.In the future, STADLER UK will continue its efforts to improve processes in the recycling industry and offer its expertise and guidance on implications of the new Deposit Return System legislation, here in the UK. Sustainability in the workplace is a key priority for STADLER UK, and together with its parent company, they will continue finding ideal solutions for every requirement to tackle the global waste problem.For more information, see below.T 01233 225 602benjamin.eule@stadler-engineering.comwww.stadler-engineering.com",

Over the years, OBW Technologies has built a strong reputation for delivering a reliable and professional range of services that include gas detection calibration, gas mapping, fire safety consultancy, instrumentation solutions, project management, gas monitor training, ex hire sales, confined space entry equipment, and service contracts. “Our specialist engineers are highly-trained on each supplier and are experts on everything their brand offers. We then have sales reps who go out and talk to different customers about our suppliers’ products and then six months later our service team will follow up with a calibration service,” explained Rebecca.Recently, OBW Technologies has been successful in winning the contract to supply Blackline Safety G7c portable gas detection monitor with Northern Ireland Water. The product will be rolling out over the next few months marking an exciting time in the future growth of the company. 2021 was also a significant year for the company as it was on the receiving end of many awards including being chosen as the supplier of the year both for Honeywell HGAS for the West Zone and Blackline Safety Europe. OBW Technologies is hoping to continue its achievements and repeat successes throughout Ireland as it directs its focus to future expansion within the UK and the EU. Hoping to mimic its industry recognised high standards here in the UK, Rebecca explained more. “We are currently working to increase our brand presence here in the UK. We are eager to mimic what we have done in Ireland and put our stamp on the UK market. Our recent expansion has also seen us increase our workforce to nearly 50 members of staff which is a great achievement for us as this was done throughout COVID-19. We are extremely proud because we actually thrived throughout COVID-19. After a few weeks we realised that we still had a lot of work servicing and calibrating lifesaving systems as many of our customers in the pharmaceutical industry were still running and therefore needed our services. Our engineers remained busy and our sales began to rise quite rapidly. Like everyone at first, we thought it may really affect business, but we managed to grow despite of it.”With the launch of its new ecommerce website at the start of 2022, OBW Technologies has a fantastic future ahead as it continues moving from strength to strength.For more information, see below.T +353 (0)818 005290info@obw.ieT 0121 3874025uksales@obwtechnologies.comwww.obwtechnologies.com",

With\nthe new MZC-II rotary valve, the producer of rotary valves and\ndiverter valves is setting a new standard in terms of functionality,\nhygiene, safety and maintenance. DMN-WESTINGHOUSE introduced the current\nMZC rotary valve 25 years ago, which has played an important role\nin increasing food safety in production processes of companies in the food\nand dairy segment, among others. With the introduction of this new rotary\nvalve, which can be opened on two sides and thus creates optimal conditions\nfor hygiene, safety, functionality and maintenance, DMN-WESTINGHOUSE\ncontinues a tradition of products that are characterised by high-quality\nengineering, durability and continuity.Due to increasingly strict requirements in the field of hygiene and\nefficiency, DMN-WESTINGHOUSE has decided to significantly improve the\nMZC rotary valve. That is why, at the beginning of 2020, a start was made\non developing the new standard and further developing the current rotary\nvalve with the aim of achieving a version that is capable of being the\nbenchmark for the long-term, in particular for the food processing sector.\nDMN-WESTINGHOUSE gave the first product demo of the MZC-II rotary\nvalve during the DMN-WESTINGHOUSE Global Salesforce Event in May of this\nyear.Risks of downtime significantly reduced  \nThe MZC-II is highly distinctive when it comes to aspects such as safety\nand hygiene, and ensures a significant reduction in downtime risks. Due to\nits double-sided opening, the new rotary valve is so intuitive to use,\nevery professional on the workplace can use, open, clean and maintain it\nwithout detailed knowledge. No specific instruction or knowledge is\nrequired to operate the rotary valve, and optimal access to the\ndrive end also allows extra thorough user-friendly cleaning. \n \nWim Korndorffer, CEO of DMN-WESTINGHOUSE, comments, “The MZC-II rotary\nvalve not only contributes to improving hygiene conditions, but also\nimproves efficiency. This significantly reduces the risk of downtime due to\ndamage and adjustment problems. Because we have taken significant steps in\nthe field of hygiene, safety and efficiency during the periodic cleaning\nand maintenance activities, we can make an important contribution to the\nfurther improvement of productivity, safety and quality for our customers\nin the dry bulk industry, from pharmaceuticals to dairy and from paint to\ncosmetics. Long-term tests under various conditions in a professional and\ncritical production environment, including a pilot with an important\ncustomer, have proven this.

          "DetailDescription": "G&P’s market-leading quality project management IT system – QTrak - is also\ncentral to the success of its multi-award winning Quality Excellence Model.\nThe two systems work in tandem to ensure manufacturing standards are\nachieved, ultimately saving costs and minimising manufacturing disruption\nfor OEMs and suppliers.Indeed, the Quality Excellence Model levers factual data regarding all non-\nconformances allowing informed decisions to be made regarding the\nmanagement and development of the supply chain.It is a total solution model driving back to the root cause to eradicate\ndisruption, quickly and effectively. And at the heart of the Quality\nExcellence Model is QTrak, allowing real-time supplier part quality\nperformance analysis and identification of quality trends.Real-time data\nG&P has been at the forefront of integrated quality management systems with\nQTrak. This has been achieved, not least, by listening to customers and\nadapting the real-time reporting system on a bespoke level tailored to\nindividual requirements.Customer feedback is pivotal in making QTrak fit for purpose and easy to\nuse, while narrowing down data to what is actually useful for the customer.Worthwhile technology for inspection software, such as QTrak, provides the\ncustomer with instant and easily accessible reports from which to make\nvalued judgements without clouding the issue unnecessarily. It is a perfect\nexample of data vs information. Data is a collection of unorganised facts\nwhile information is the structured and organised presentation of that\ndata. QTrak assembles the data and provides the information.A focus on what matters\nOne of QTrak’s key assets is that it has been developed by G&P and built\nfrom the ground up. This provides complete autonomy for software upgrades\nand also allows the flexibility to provide bespoke solutions for any\ncustomer should they be required – creating a system that is entirely\nfocused on their needs. Once again, it highlights that the technology\nitself is driven by human insight and needs.Reporting and sorting\nWhile various IT systems have their own goals, the role of QTrak is to\nimprove communication, provide a higher level of accuracy in inspection\nprocesses, standardise reporting processes and deliver control throughout\nthe product manufacturing lifecycle.These guiding principles will always remain the same while the technology\nitself is upgraded to handle the fast-moving developments in various\nmanufacturing sectors such as automotive and aerospace as they deal with an\never-shifting landscape, not least the importance of low carbon propulsion.As QTrak provides instantaneous results, it allows problematic supply\nsources to be investigated without delay, parts contained and corrective\naction to be deployed to prevent further defective components from being\nproduced.The importance of QTrak is even stronger today and it continues to receive\nhigh levels of internal investment. In doing so, customers can use up to\nthe minute data to support their problem solving process and to identify\nquickly any risks to continuity of production from stock losses, including\nat sister sites which might face similar quality issues.Armed with such vital and instantly accessible information, G&P’s customers\ngain an important edge over their competitors as they have the power to\nmake critical business decisions based on factual data without delay.\nFurthermore, as QTrak is totally electronic it speeds up the approval\nprocess before a project commences, ultimately reducing the reaction time\nfor G&P’s highly skilled teams to start their vitally important work.In combination with G&P’s supplier quality engineers and inspection teams,\nQTrak is the backbone to G&P’s award winning Quality Excellence Model,\nwhere thousands of problems have been successfully contained, investigated\nand eradicated. The result is that G&P is increasingly seen as a strategic\npartner, often with sole responsibility for the management of inbound\ncomponent quality and the response to quality issues.To learn more, visit: www.gpqm.com\n",

Caravanning, camping, holiday cottages and hotels have now\nbeen joined by Glamping pods, log cabins, tree houses and a variety of\nother innovations in the quest to attract visitors. Located in woods,\nforests, fields and farms. The more unusual the location, the more\nappealing it seems to be.Situated on the edge of the rolling Lincolnshire Wolds, an ‘Area of Natural\nBeauty’, Galley Hill Farm is run by Sandra and Ian Scaman, who run a\nsuccessful ‘Pick Your Own’ business alongside the farm, as well as a\ncaravan site in a stunning woodland grove adjacent to the family farmhouse.The busy site encompasses a block with shower and WC’s and has recently\nexpanded from 5 to 10 pitches to satisfy demand from new and repeat\ncustomers. Waste from the house and the toilet block is discharged to a\nseptic tank that was recently upgraded due to new regulations that came\ninto effect in 2020. A separate chemical disposal point was also installed\nfor the caravan site.The couple identified the opportunity to expand still further by clearing a\nfurther area of ground to make way for Glamping pods. They spoke to Saniflo\nto discuss the options for discharging the water as the woodland clearing\nhad insufficient gravity fall to reach the septic tank some 70m away. A\nsite visit later and the Saniflo Sanifos 610 was recommended thanks to its\nample capacity and multiple connection points. Two pods with bathroom,\nbedroom, kitchen and living room have been installed on site with space for\ntwo more in time. The Sanifos 610 has 612-litre tank capacity and twin\npumps which work alternately to ensure even wear of the motors. In the\nevent of a pump failure, the other will take over all functions to ensure\ncontinuity of service until the fault is identified and repaired. A smart\ncontrol box was installed into a small shed adjacent to the pods where it\nhouses all the electrics and monitors the performance of the unit. An alarm\nis supplied as a standard feature for early warning of any issues.With exceptional returns for self-contained accommodation, Sandra and Ian\nare looking forward to welcoming the first customers in 2022 in advance of\nthe fruit picking season.T 020 8842 0033\nwww.saniflo.co.uk\n",

An additional ‘enable button,’ without edge monitoring, can be switched into the feedback loop. The F0 version is suitable for small machines without a protective space that can be accessed behind.The F1 version is recommended for smaller systems, where the hazardous area can be accessed by the operator, as it has a reset function. The edge-monitored reset button must be pressed before the machine is restarted – when it is clear that the system is in a safe state and that no one is in the hazardous area. This function is consistent with the ‘manual reset function’ in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1.Steve Watkins, Marketing & Business Development,T 01684 571980swatkins@schmersal.com www.schmersal.co.uk",

In addition, Schmersal has optimised the interlock as well\nas developed additional versions that incorporate specific customer\nrequirements.\n\nThe new development has generated considerable market interest thanks to\nits compact ‘on-trend’ dimensions. With dimensions of 119.5 x 40 x 20mm,\nthe AZM40 is the smallest electronic solenoid interlock in the world. The\nAZM40 is the ideal safety solution for all machine builders looking for\noptimisation through miniaturisation, simplification and minimisation of\nmaterials.\n\nThe compact AZM40 can also be installed easily in confined and hard-to-\naccess areas thanks to 180° angular flexibility of the actuator. An added\nbenefit is its universal use on rotary and sliding doors with a single\ndesign version.\n\nNew enclosure versions\nThe AZM40 solenoid interlock and actuator are available in two enclosure\nversions. For typical use in mechanical engineering, there are enclosures\nwith a flat, screw-on surface for cylinder-head bolts. For visually\nimproved installation and where space saving is a priority, there is a\nversion with countersunk tapers for countersunk bolts.\n\nLow-energy safety solution\nThe AZM40 operates to a bistable holding principle. This means that it\nmaintains its locking position and securely holds the guard door in the\nevent of power failure, thereby preventing hazardous run-on movements. In\naddition, energy consumption with the bistable principle is lower.\n\nContact: Steve Watkins\nswatkins@schmersal.com\nwww.schmersal.co.uk\n",

          "DetailDescription": "By Imtex Controls\n\nAll industrial operations are continually driving to improve efficiency and\nproductivity to increase profit margins and maximise bottom-line returns.\nIn many sectors (such as the oil and gas industry), this drive occurs\nagainst a back drop of heightened health and safety demands and\nenvironmental concerns as well as the need to implement improvements on old\nassets that can often be operating beyond their initial design life.\n\nAn important means of delivering on these expectations is to reduce the\nnumber of unscheduled plant shutdowns. On average 92% of shutdowns are\nunplanned and cost oil and gas companies an estimated $42-88 million a year\nin worst case scenarios. It has been observed that most unplanned shutdowns\nare often attributable to worn out equipment, and in a lot of cases is due\nto the lifespan of an element being exceeded.\n\nWith a routine maintenance schedule and a condition monitoring solution,\noperators could prevent costly shutdowns and increase production up time,\nreduce maintenance spend and improve plant safety. A study by GE found that\ndata monitoring helped improve oil and gas maintenance schedules resulting\nin a 36% reduction in unplanned downtime, which in turn resulted in an\naverage of a $17 million improvement to the bottom line.\n\nAs such, asset monitoring, asset management, and predictive maintenance\nsolutions are gaining popularity.\n\nCondition monitoring on valves\nAs valves are a critical constituent element of any flow-based process,\nvalve performance is an important factor to review when trying to prevent\nunscheduled maintenance, plant shut downs and loss of batch production. The\nimmediate effect of valve problems can then be the failure to meet client\nexpectations while indirect effects may include higher insurance premiums\nand increased HSE scrutiny, meaning that valve problems can often be very\ncostly.\n\nWhile some operators are already deploying condition monitoring on control\nvalves and critical valves, many valves, notably those used for on/off\nprocess and shutdown applications, are often left unmonitored.\n\nWhy aren’t valves being monitored?\nWhile technology is available to monitor these valves, operators are\ndissuaded from this investment primarily due to the prohibitive hardware\nand installations costs.\n\nAlthough some OEMs have touted various valve testing and monitoring\nsystems, many of the solutions offered can pose operational, financial\nand/or functional implementation issues. This is because they are generally\nsignificantly more costly than traditional systems; can require\ninstallation of new wiring and hardware and can have software integration.\nWhere the automation is of relatively low value, as is the case with on/off\nvalves, it can be difficult to justify the time and money involved with\nimplementing a useful condition monitoring solution.\n\nIf and when condition monitoring systems are installed on automated on/off\nvalves, they typically require trained personnel to perform the monitoring\ntask. However, due to a lack of training, lack of specific valve knowledge\nand insufficient time available, data will often only be analysed for a\nsmall fraction of automated on/off valves, if at all.\n\nThe result of all these factors is that, in the current environment, vast\nswathes of on/off valves are not being monitored and subsequently\nmaintained in a meaningful or useful way, contributing to a significant\nincreased risk of valve failures.\n\nIntroducing the Valve Diagnostic Monitoring System\nImtex Controls has been developing and manufacturing solutions for the\nprocess industries for over 30 years. As part of this history, Imtex has\nbeen supplying valve monitoring and testing solutions that are easily\nimplemented to both new and ageing assets, to enable operators to log data\nfrom shut down valves for a number of years. However, it became obvious\nthat while operators are keen to explore condition monitoring solutions,\ninvestment in this area has been limited due to the lack of a simple, cost-\neffective solution that allows for automated end-to-end data acquisition\nand analysis.\n\nFollowing experience in data capturing for critical valves, a NEW automated\nvalve diagnostic monitoring system (VDMS) has been developed to resolve all\nthe implementation and investment issues. By providing seamless monitoring\nof automated valves using a simple but fully integrated, end to end\nsolution, the system helps to deliver a safe and more productive plant of\nthe future.\n\nThe component parts of the VDMS system allow this type of system to be\ninstalled without any extra cabling, no additional software, and no change\nin procedures, all for a similar cost to a standard valve position\ntransmitter. This makes VDMS the first of its kind.\n\nThe difference between the VDMS and other technology available is that it\nis easy to install in both green field and brown field environments with\nminimal additional infrastructure requirements, but allows every valve\noperation to be automatically captured, analysed and acted upon if\nnecessary through a Cloud-based diagnostics application.\n\nThe system monitors the health of automated valves through comparative and\nreal time analysis of every valve operation with the goal of predicting\ntime to valve failure. Maintenance and pro-active interventions can then be\nscheduled in advance of any issues. By cost effectively installing this\ntechnology on all automated valves, a plant can ensure efficiency of\nproduction, as well as prevent unscheduled delay and unsafe plant\ncondition.\n\nThis technology is useful for all stages of plant operation and so can\nprovide an opportunity to improve efficiency, safety and security of all\nplants, existing and future.\n\nWith big data now being recognised as the future of industrial and\nmanufacturing processes, it’s innovations like the VDMS that can make all\nthe difference to data aggregation for safety, efficiency and not least\nprofitability.\n\nT 08700 340002\ninfo@imtex-controls.com\n",

          "DetailDescription": "Tooling expert Walter GB says Industry 4.0 means different things to different people and, indeed, the phrase very often causes uncertainty among production engineers, especially those in small/medium sized companies. However, after addressing digitalisation some years ago, Walter has specifically developed, for such users, its Nexxt digital products and Industry 4.0 solutions. \n\nThese include the Comara iCut software tool, which is based on the real-time analysis of incoming machine data. Comara has not re-invented milling or turning with the iCut adaptive feed control bus has focused on getting the most out of a machine without making major changes to the existing process or carrying out complex and time-consuming programming work. \n\nThe software is integrated into the existing control program and applies the data for the machining process. In the first cut, iCut ‘learns’ the idling output of the spindle and the maximum cutting efficiency per cut. Then it measures spindle output, at up to 500 times per second and automatically adjusts the feed and, as a result, the machine operates at the maximum feed that iCut has ‘learned’ for each tool, whenever possible. \n\nIf the cutting conditions change, perhaps owing to varying contact angles and depths of cut, fluctuations in allowance or due to signs of tool wear, iCut adapts the speed and output in real time and the resulting optimised milling increases process reliability and boosts production output, at least by 10%.\n\nIn addition, the forces on the spindle are more constant which increases its service life and, if the tool is in danger of breaking, iCut immediately reduces the feed or stops the action. \n\nComara has also developed the appCom software platform to make all the data generated during the machining process usable for process optimisation. Comara appCom comprises two components: a PC, which is installed in the machines and integrated in the control system and the software, which analyses and displays data. \n\nWalter uses the app principle for this and even the basic version of appCom features more than 13 apps which can be used to collect and monitor parameters including machine status, productivity and the stability of the programs being run. Company-specific apps can also be programmed and displayed.\n\nIn addition, the system can identify current problems and critical processes as well as analyse all production processes on a machine. Parameters include efficiency, costs per tool or per workpiece and process reliability. This produces live data to be used to optimise and plan production. Comara appCom can also be connected to ERP systems. \n\nAccording to a spokesman at Walter GB: 'While various factors determine the potential efficiency and savings that result from the use of a monitoring and analysis software platform such as appCom, we can say that appCom users do see a significant increase of productivity and process reliability.' \nWalter AG was founded in 1919 and is now one of the world’s leading metalworking companies.

          "DetailDescription": "William Cook is a UK manufacturer of track running gear for armored vehicles. Their relentless drive to engineer, test, and produce the best products in this category has propelled them to their position as a global industry leader. William Cook is the main supplier of vehicle tracks to the British Army, in addition to having their products on the majority of armored fighting vehicles worldwide.\n\nThese vehicle tracks include a key component – track pins – which are designed to endure intense wear and tear from large, fast moving vehicles on uneven terrain. Components are produced to be strong, lightweight, and durable – at enormous production volumes. The material used is challenging to machine, and the combination of design and production demands leaves no room for compromise.\n\nTrack pins have a deep hole throughout the length of the part, which William Cook had previously been sending out to be gundrilled. A company-wide initiative to further modernize production provided plant systems engineer Brian Birkett with the responsibility of not only bringing the process in-house, but to also educate himself and his team on the foundations of deep hole gun drilling.\n\nConfidence Begins with Education\nDeep holes exist in the majority of industries, and many manufacturers such as William Cook encounter these applications, typically considered holes with a depth-to-diameter ratio of 20:1 or greater. When manufacturers are inexperienced with the process and equipment, the specific challenges can seem intimidating to go through alone. However, deep hole drilling uses modern tools, machines, and technology and follows proven methods. With the right partner and experience, in-sourcing the process and planning for long-term gundrilling success is easily manageable.\n\nThe team at William Cook initially brought their application to UNISIG for a machine solution, but according to Brian, UNISIG provided more than just a recommendation. UNISIG’s technical team provided in-depth foundation information about the gundrilling process, available tooling, and the right machine to meet their needs.\n\nBrian and UNISIG discussed a heavy duty, multi-spindle gundrilling machine, designed to maximize the production potential of high-feed indexable gundrilling tools. Following this initial proposal, the team visited the Wisconsin, USA facility to see the process and machines first hand, meet with the technical team to review the application in detail, and learn what goes into the precision of UNISIG machines.\n\n'UNISIG’s knowledge of how our application would benefit from indexable gundrilling was influential in our decision to go with them' he stated. 'They clearly explained what we needed to know, addressed all the questions we had, and brought confidence in what ultimately was our solution.'\n\nBrian went on to explain that the combination of process, plus procedure, plus expertise contributed to their first-class experience with UNISIG, throughout the entire process. He praised the team for immediately being able to recognize and understand the demands of the application, and do a thorough job of presenting a solution – one which has lived up to expectations.\n\nIntuitive and Powerful\nThe UNI-25HD machine at William Cook is currently running full production with three products, and plans to expand their part lineup. The machine is surpassing William Cook’s expectations for required cycle time, with the high gundrill feed rates and multiple spindles, made possible with matched power and torque requirements on the machine.\n\nLoading automation is seamlessly integrated to maintain a steady production pace with less operator effort. Brian believes that they have a solution that is perfectly aligned to their part and performance requirements.\n\n'The machines are perfectly paced to keep up with production. The machines do exactly what was promised. UNISIG knows what they are talking about, and our expectations are exceeded.'\n\nBrian also praised the ease of operation, with UNISIG’s standard PLC interface and a thorough training session, allowing the team to feel completely confident with deep hole drilling. The straightforward operation allows them to set up their program and let the machine do the work, while operators monitor the process and look for improvements. 'It’s such a benefit. It’s so easy to learn', he commented.\n\nOverall, the initial payback from the investment is expected to take place within 2 to 3 years, according to the team, and the long-term impact will be substantial.\n\nSupport Feels Close to Home\nHaving close support post-installation was another priority to William Cook. Partnering with an international supplier can sometimes create distance, but this was not the case with UNISIG. Technical support teams are quickly able to access the machine and the operating staff to diagnose and troubleshoot, even when remote. The technical support from early on in the sales process, to responsiveness after installation has set UNISIG apart from others.\n\n'UNISIG’s service team responds quickly to take care of any issues, just as if we were next door. Support feels close to home.' \n\nBrian’s confidence with the UNISIG machine and partnership has influenced William Cook’s long-term reliable production, and a modern solution that aligns with the future of their company.\n\nwww.unisig.com",

          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is pleased to announce TYRI as our Lighting Company of the Month, for its ingenuity and technological innovation in the lighting industry. \nTYRI was created in 2002 by three partner companies based in the USA, UK and Sweden with extensive experience in the work lighting field. Initially, the company started out in mining and forestry, which offer a very unique set of challenges for both machines and lighting. They built on their legacy in these demanding industries and now develop lighting for a variety of applications with a main focus on the harshest environments of off highway, including Material Handling, Agriculture, Construction and Heavy Vehicles. \nAlongside the three headquarter locations, TYRI has additional sales offices in Brazil, France, Italy, Japan, Russia, Norway and South Korea; this network ensures global distribution with local support.\nTYRI has a dedicated Research and Development department based in Sweden with an onsite, state of the art, testing facility. TYRI work lights comply with all international safety standards and undergo rigorous testing to ensure they can hold up to the punishing regimes of all off highway machines.\nBoasting a large range of standard work lights, TYRI also works as a design partner alongside OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) customers to bespoke solutions to exact customer requirements. They revel in the challenge of designing and developing new products using cutting edge techniques. The group is rich in specialist knowledge and experience, engaging with experts in optics, testing and design to create a quality product that delivers on performance and style.\nTYRI works with some of the most recognisable names in the industry such as Hyster Yale, Toyota Material Handling, John Deere and Jeep, to name just a few. The group is dedicated to providing effective lighting in all aspects of their function. \nIn an industry first, TYRI recently launched a revolutionary new Heavy Vehicle Lighting System, controllable via one easy to use mobile app. The INTELLi light system works on a wireless communication network, lights are interconnected via Bluetooth (closed network) which is integrated with the vehicle and controlled with the App. All information is saved, and lights are zoned according to work situation, external circumstances and the current user. \nHead of Research and Development Christian Wadell said 'Since the system can be controlled via an app (iOS and Android) the lights can be quickly zoned and recognised according to the requirements of the work. At the same time, we wanted a system that would deter theft of light, which we achieved through each light needing to be connected to the closed network in order to function.' \nAs an industry leader, TYRI’s Research and Development department constantly monitor global trends in the industry and attempts to predict new innovations and technologies, adapting to their differing needs, one such trend is the increasing introduction of autonomous vehicles. \n'Here one can either predict a death sentence for heavy vehicle lighting or choose to view it as an opportunity and adapt the development. Even if autonomous heavy vehicles will impact the industry as seems to be the case today, I think that the development pertaining to autonomous vehicles can encourage the discovery of new ways of working with lighting,' says Wadell. \nThis summer, will also see an upgrade to TYRI’s UK facility, implementing a new carousel system and new robots, these changes will see the UK’s production capacity double to meet the growing needs of its customers.\nT 01756 700568\nAnnette.brown@tyri.co.uk",

Originally starting in hull, in their first site on Dansom Lane, the company started trading as Hull Motor Transport and Engineering Co, manufacturing pistons and providing cylinder grinding. Starting small, the company provided car and commercial vehicle repair within the local motor trade. \n\nMaintaining its original prospects, is something that Kingston Engineering prides themselves on, dating back to their leadership of Robert Markham and Thomas Simpkins, who designed the business around the concept of giving a bespoke customised personal service for clients, which is something the company still  adheres to today. With only 10 employees, the business was smaller and extremely customer service focused, in early years, creating growing success. Expansion was clearly on the horizon for Kingston Engineering, even within the early years enabling Kingston Engineering to be able to provide general engineering services. This success and reputation, later expanded further for the company, with Kingston Engineering obtaining a renowned reputation for repairing both saw milling machinery and printing machinery. \n\nKingston Engineering Co. Ltd eventually gained its name in 1924 and the development of manufacturing screws began in 1930, which has proved to be a very significant departure for the business.\n\nExpanding through decades marked by World War One, and World War Two is something that not many businesses could achieve, however 1930-1945 saw expansion for Kingston Engineering, with World War Two bringing in a development of manufacturing components required for aircraft undercarriages.\n\nLeading the company to expand and develop its manufacturing facilities, (Kingston Engineering was very fortunate to be mostly unaffected by any bomb damage.) Kingston Engineering’s expertise and experience helped them maintain and expand throughout these hard decades. In fact, their workforce also increased within 1930-1945, through the high demand of their services. \n\nThe evolution of the company during the next 20 years, took flight at the end of World War Two. Operating from a larger site in Pennington Street, Kingston Engineering began their successful journey of specialising in screw manufacturing. Even within these early years, Kingston Engineering began to engage with their ethos of investing in the company, leading them to increase their skills through the installation of new modern machinery. Their skilful repute gave Kingston Engineering the perfect platform in growing and exporting globally, as their specialist screw manufacturing brought in a new market, expanding to Australia and South Africa.\n\nThe arrival of the sixties saw a shift in terms of counter sales for Kingston Engineering, the company moved from motor sales to industrial sales. Furthermore, the sixties contained many major development factors for the company including, investments in the factory, expansion in exporting, the purchasing of modern machinery, expansion of product range and an ‘Off the Shelf’ service introduced. The company now had extremely well-equipped workshops, enabling them to accommodate facilitates for milling, shaping, welding, grinding and turning. \n\nThrough accommodating these facilitate, Kingston Engineering further expanded their factory premises. Their product range advanced notably within this era too, leading to a vast range of screws, sprockets, chains, pumps and bearings; there was also an expansion for their sprayed coating services where Kingston Engineering now offers the service for worn components. In terms of their exporting, Kinston Engineering saw further developments within this span of 20 years and had now began exporting across Europe. In 1979, the company celebrated its milestone of 60 years and was being run by two direct descendants of the two founding families. \n\nThe introduction of the digital years throughout the 1980s saw the rise of new advancements within engineering industries. Digital technology further increased Kingston Engineering’s already established skills and gave them the perfect tool in broadening their production skillset.\n\nMoving onto recent years, Kingston Engineering has now established a dominating presence within the engineering sector. With more and more technological advancements being used within manufacturing, Kingston Engineering has developed significantly, in terms of modern machinery and in-house facilities.\n\nExamining their amazing 100 year of production up to today, Kingston Engineering has built an extremely positive reputation which has allowed them to produce top of the range products. Through such a detailed rich history of skilful work behind them, Kingston Engineering has shown great flexibility, showcasing the adaptability of the company, throughout the decades. Supported by their expert team and managed by working directors, their skills and experience, are at the heart of the company’s success. \n\nWith a great customer service focus, Kingston Engineering provides a quick, efficient service with help from their 40 plus skilled workforce. It is clear to see how Kingston Engineering has become one of UK’s leading specialist manufacturers and producers of bespoke Power Screws.\n\nMaintaining the company’s successful 100 years, has never been more important to Kingston Engineering. Inspired to further themselves, they even have recent developments, including investment in a new Mituoyo Euro M544 Measuring Machine, which has become a significant tool for their inspection department. \n\nThe machine allows Kingston Engineering to measure the physical geometrical characteristics of an object. The machine creates printed inspection reports and is controlled by an operator, with measurements designed by a probe attached to the third moving axis of the machine. Proving to be a great example of Kingston Engineering’s commitment to constantly improving through investing, the machine benefits the company/clients significantly, especially through the machine producing an accurate drawing of the part that can be used for the manufacture of bespoke items. \n\nKingston Engineering’s current directors are Paul Bielby, Mike Hutchinson and Gill Hickson, who are leading the company to achieve and maintain its established, excellence and professionalism within all aspects of their business. Through their unrivalled skills and years of experience, they are clearly setting the way for Kingston Engineering and helping the company deliver its exceptional services to their customers.\n\nA privately owned business, this prestigious 100 year milestone is a testimony to the company’s sheer determination to invest through their skilled team of workers, facilities and technologies. It is clear to see that over the years, the company have significantly invested in their machinery for continued success. The company’s current directors have an unprecedented, more than 100 years of experience between them and are continuously engaging in plans to help the company become global leaders in screw manufacturing. \n\nCongratulations Kingston Engineering, on achieving your 100 year anniversary and clearly setting the way for a further successful future. \n\nT 01482 325676\nwww.kingston-engineering.co.uk\n",

          "DetailDescription": "Celebrating One Hundred Years Of Engineering Excellence\n\nPRECISION ENGINEERING SPECIALISTS\nwww.kingston-engineering.co.uk\n\nOur Story\nAt Kingston Engineering, we have been delivering cutting edge engineering solutions to our customers, for over 100 years. Our Centenary Year marks a very important celebration for us and we are proud to chart our history through the decades.\n\nToday, as one of the UK’s leading specialist manufacturers and producers of specialist power screws, we continue to build on a strong foundation of skill, innovation and expertise.\n\nBacked by a focus of continuous investment and advanced technology over the years, our global presence is testament to how Kingston Engineering has evolved across the decades, from when we first started out, back in 1919.\n\nA History Built On Engineering Expertise\nFrom the very beginning, the Kingston Engineering story has been one characterised by the ability to constantly evolve and innovate. With a heritage built on a strong foundation of engineering skill, innovation and expertise, our business has shown great flexibility and responsiveness to change across the decades. This still remains the very cornerstone of our business today and the measure of our success.\n\nThe Kingston Engineering Story...\nOur business was founded in 1919, at a time when street parties celebrated peace, following the end of a long period of conflict at the end of the First World War. Jubilant street scenes up and down the country signalled the return of the troops, with the signing of the Treaty Of Versailles in 1919 formally ending the war. This is the time frame for the beginning of the Kingston Engineering story.\n\nIn an era defined by a nation getting back on its feet, our company was starting out in Hull. What was remarkable at the time, is that whilst the city of Hull had been badly bombed, our business and many others at the time, showed remarkable courage and inspiration by emerging from the midst of a broken industrial landscape.\n\nThe Early Years...\n\nStarting Out In 1919\nWe first began trading as Hull Motor Transport and Engineering Co in 1919, providing car and commercial vehicle repairs to the motor trade. In those early years, when we were based at our original site on Dansom Lane in Hull, our business provided cylinder grinding and manufactured pistons.\n\nUnder the leadership of Fred Markham, one of the best engineers in the area at the time and Thomas Simpkins, the business focussed on giving customers a personal service. With a staff of ten employees and with growing success, the business soon began to offer general engineering services. In these very early years, the company also gained a growing reputation for the repair of saw milling machinery and also the repair of printing machinery.\n\nThe 20s Through To The 40s\nIn 1924, the business changed its name to Kingston Engineering Co. Ltd. As early as 1930, the company first started making screws, which would prove to be a very significant departure for the business.\n\nFrom 1930 to 1945 and marked by the Second World War, Kingston Engineering was to significantly expand and develop its manufacturing facilities. During this time the company was also manufacturing components for aircraft undercarriages and most notably for the Stirling Bomber.\n\nThe workforce was to also significantly increase at this time. It was to be a very fortunate period for Kingston Engineering, as the company premises were mostly unaffected by bomb damage during this time.\n\nThe Post War Years\nThe years following on from the end of World War Two marked a time when Kingston Engineering was rapidly becoming more specialised in screw manufacture. Now based on a significantly bigger site close by in Pennington Street, further developments during this next period saw the installation of more modern machinery. An increase in skill levels meant that power transmission screws up to 30ft long were being produced, as well as extruder screws.\n\nKingston Engineering had at this time a growing reputation for manufacturing machinery for the home market, as well as a growing export market in Australia and South Africa. Skills developed during the war years were further developed, so that specialist machinery was now being produced to order. The growth of the machinery repairs side of the business was also expanded. Further advancements during these post war years included the addition of new services for moving, resting and installing machinery.\n\nApproaching The Millennium...\n\nMilestones From The 60s To The 80s\nFor Kingston Engineering, this period was marked by significant investment in the factory premises and particularly in modern machinery. Well-equipped workshops ensured that the company had extensive facilities for turning, milling, grinding, shaping and welding.\n\nActivities moved from motor sales to industrial sales and the range of power transmission chains, bearings and pumps continued to expand, as did the sprayed coatings side of the business, now offered for worn components.\n\nThis period marked a significant milestone for Kingston Engineering in that they were now manufacturing specialist power screw products for increasingly advanced markets, brought about by major technological developments. An off the shelf service in standard screw products was also introduced at this time.\n\nExport markets across Europe were further developed, as demand for the specialist skills of Kingston Engineering expanded. As the company celebrated its 60th anniversary in 1979, direct descendants of the two founder families were at the helm.\n\nEvolving In The Digital Era\nThe emergence of the new media age brought with it many advancements as the engineering industry harnessed the power of digital technology.\n\nWith an increasingly evolving digital landscape, Kingston Engineering’s wealth of skill and flexibility meant that the company was well equipped to respond to these changing and challenging times.\n\nProgress In The Decades To Follow\nThe next few decades saw significant technological developments and with it major investment in new machinery and in house facilities at Kingston Engineering. With a heritage built on the foundations of skill, innovation and expertise, the company has shown great flexibility and the ability to be responsive to change over the years.\n\nThis has enabled Kingston Engineering to offer advanced engineering solutions to customers and lead the way as one of the UK’s leading specialist manufacturers and producers of bespoke Power Screws.\n\nA Present & Future Built On Skill, Innovation and Expertise\nIn reaching our 100 year milestone at Kingston Engineering, as a privately owned company, we are proud to value our input of our employees. While many of our workforce have spent most of their working lives with us, we also continue to invest in training as part of our commitment to support the generations to come. Our current apprenticeship programmes ensure that we are well equipped to embrace our future.\n\nOur policy is also to continually invest in our extensive in house facilities and also in new technology, as we approach the next chapter in our history. This will enable us to continue to deliver cutting edge precision engineering solutions to our customers. At Kingston Engineering, our specialised precision engineering services are built on a wealth of experience and a strong heritage spanning 100 years. Our commitment to engineering excellence will continue to mark our years ahead.\n\nKingston Engineering is delighted to mark our Centenary Year.\nSince 1919, we have built our business on skill, innovation and expertise.\n\nwww.kingston-engineering.co.uk\nKingston Engineering Co.

Initially established as a boiler manufacturer, the company has held fast to this specialism, accumulating over a century of rich experience. CFB Boilers are renowned manufacturers of UK-manufactured vertical steam boilers, and are even an OEM partner of Bosch Boilers. \n\nWith their purpose-built manufacturing facility in Essex, CFB Boilers deliver to clients from a number of different industries. The family-owned business offers a range of services including boiler design, quick and efficient installation, maintenance and repair. With cost-effective prices, a quick order turnaround and first rate customer service, not to mention remarkably innovative products, it's not hard to see why CFB Boilers are trusted by so many to deliver premier services every time. Their products can be found in an array of different industries, though CFB specialise in small craft breweries, universities, pharmaceuticals and the food sector. \n\nCFB Boilers have a variety of different steam boilers available such as the Series 4VT range, the Universal Series UL-S and more. As well as being the UK's longest standing steam expert, CFB Boilers are also the first and only steam service provider in the world to create a boiler unit that is not only energy-saving, but features a reverse osmosis feature that provides the same high performance expected of CFB Boilers at half the price. Named the BoilerRO, this unit features semi-permeable membranes with fine pores which catch 99% of inorganic ions and dissolved organic contaminants in the pressurised feedwater. Not only does this help the boiler run more efficiently, but it also minimises the frequency of boiler blowdowns and hence leads to significant energy savings. \n\nCFB have a wide availability of energy saving boiler options, such as the Series 4VT Steam Boiler 8. This class leading system features energy-saving four-pass technology and integral heat recovery. It also has a 30% larger steam chamber despite its compact design. The 4VT Steam Boiler has been praised for its energy efficiency and low running costs which leads to significant energy savings as well as cost savings. The four-pass technology allows for optimum heat transfer and guarantees low exit flue temperatures.\n\nIn addition to being energy saving, the 4VT comes with a range of added benefits such as a 10-15 minute start up, easy installation, and smart structuring for easy cleaning and maintenance. On top of this, the tubeless construction of the machine leads to reduced metal stress and less need for descaling. \n\nCFB offer a great many turnkey solutions for steam, hot water and other such projects. Some of their current projects are with Sellafield Power Station, Cambridge University, Calor Gas and a number of various breweries, just to name a few.\nWe asked Service Manager, Lucy Burton what we can expect of CFB in the future. She explained, 'We are expanding our building by adding another floor to increase our training facilities and service administration offices. We have increased our services personnel and technical support by 4 additional people.\n\n'We have a dedicated service team who provide service and maintenance contracts which are tailored to the specific needs of every customer. Our contracts are popular with customers across a wide range of industries especially where the boiler is an integral part of everyday operation, providing peace of mind from a friendly and knowledgeable team. \n\n 'We also offer Boilerhouse training which can either be carried out at a customer's site or at our offices in Essex once our new conference room is completed towards the end of 2017. We recommend that at least one operative on every site undertakes training with a qualified CFB engineer to ensure that the correct operational procedures are adhered to.'\n\nThe company attends a number of trade shows, such as Beer X where they displayed their many wares and attracted new brewery clients and business.

          "DetailDescription": "Rimblades Limited has been selected as our Automotive Solution Provider of the Month, we are delighted to reveal here at Business and Industry Today.\n\nOperating firmly within the automotive aftermarket, Rimblades is a dedicated manufacturer and supplier of products used as alloy wheel rim protectors on cars. The solutions are essentially utilised on the wheels of a vehicle to protect them from kerb damage, although they can also be employed to cover existing impairments (eliminating the necessity for new wheels or refurbishment) or to enhance the appearance of its exterior with a noticeable colour styling trim.\n\nThe sophisticated alloy wheel rim protectors were conceptualised by Darren Bowden, Managing Director at Rimblades Limited and Partner Rimblades USA LLC. The innovator successfully developed the original prototype, which was a simple DIY product suitably named Rimblades, and set to establishing his own business revolved around this invention. The enterprise was officially launched in December 2010 and since then Darren has remained committed to refining and extending the range where possible.\n\nThe lightweight system, which combines protection, style and performance, is now available in different kits at various price points. Darren was keen to tell us more about the main advantages of purchasing from Rimblades: “We stand out from our competitors in the marketplace for our great value for money,” he commented. “Our products can do a variety of things - they can cover, protect and enhance a set of wheels all at a far lower cost than the alternatives.”\n\nAs well as selling direct to retailers, traders and the public via its online shop, the company maximises the resources of its solid distribution network to provide an even more efficient delivery service, formulating different arrangements in accordance with specific countries and regions. Its customer base is therefore relatively varied and comprises both smaller dealers supplying a fitted service for its products (those within the car valeting, vinyl wrap and window tint markets, for example) and big brand end clients such as Renault, Nissan, Hertz, BMW, JLR, Mercedes, Halfords and Argos. The Rimblades have also proven popular with wheel refurbishments companies and the team are pleased to have secured a number of online resellers.\n\nThe designing and manufacturing business, which operates from an office base in Somerset and a factory in Cornwall, has impressively developed more rim protectors than any other company of its kind. Following the original Rimblades line the team created Rimbands a year later and then RimSavers, which is an extension of the brand that is suitable for installation by both amateurs and professionals. 2017 will see the release of its redeveloped Rimblade and Rimband products, and the IP has just been granted on many other new designs.\n\n“We’re still looking for trade partners and investors to grow the brand considerably,” Darren concluded. “Alloy wheels have grown in size considerably over recent years and most cars have 17” plus wheels. Kerbs are still the same height, so wheel damage in an inevitable part of driving nowadays. \n\n“Most of the public still aren’t aware these products exist - this was evident when we had a trade stand at the Goodwood Revival this year. We had a great time at this superb event and whilst speaking to customers just about everyone that saw us said “what a great idea”, so the key is getting the message out there. We have also recently set up our own distribution company in the USA, Rimblades USA LLC, and we are putting a lot of effort now into that market. Overall our main target is growth and increasing the company value.”",

          "DetailDescription": "Rapid International Ltd recently commissioned a new Rapidmix 400CW, fully\nweighed, mobile continuous mixing plant (pugmill) for Thalle Construction\nCompany (A Tully Group Company) in Leonard, Texas. The new Rapidmix is\nbeing utilised for the production of high volume structural concrete and\nsoil cement on the $37 million project to construct raw water storage for\nthe Bois D’Arc Regional Water Treatment Plant.\n\nAbout Thalle Construction Co\nEstablished in New York in 1947, Thalle Construction Co offers a wide range\nof construction and construction material services including dams,\nlandfills, site work, communication technology, and roller compacted\nconcrete. Thalle has been a member of Tully Group since 2012.\n\nFirst new major reservoir in Texas in nearly 30 years\nThe Bois D’Arc Regional Water Treatment Plant forms part of the larger $1.6\nbillion Bois D’Arc Reservoir and Regional Water Supply Project by the North\nTexas Municipal Water District. The project will supply 70 million gallons\ndaily (MGD) initially to customers in North Texas – one of the nation’s\nfastest-growing regions.\n\nThe project consists of 1.1 million yards of mass excavation to construct a\n262,000.00 SY, 7.6 million gallon raw water storage reservoir, 1. 9 miles\nof 96” & 90” steel raw water line and 8,000 LF of associated yard piping.\n\nThe reservoir will be lined with the latest technology geomembrane and HDP\nliner covered in 12” soil cement.\n\nRapid/Thalle collaboration enables Rapid pugmill to produce high volume\nstructural concrete\nThalle required a mixing solution with the flexibility to produce both high\nand low slump concrete at volume in one machine.\n\nWith a proportionally higher volume of soil cement required (over 100,000\nCY versus 6,000 CY of structural concrete), the decision was taken to adapt\nthe Rapidmix mobile continuous mixing plant, specifically designed for semi-\ndry mixes, to enable production of higher slump structural concrete.\n\nThe adaptation involved running a water line with admixture ports directly\ninto the discharge hopper and installation of a shoot port with 18”\ndischarge pipe and trunk, allowing the plant to operate in its normal\nmanner. Final mixing is subsequently accomplished in the truck.\n\nRobert Farrow, Project Manager- Thalle Construction Co remarked, “The\nprocess has been very successful...” He continued, “Thalle has successfully\npoured in excess of 800 CY/ day of the structural concrete and looks\nforward to increasing our production on the soil cement. The project is\ncurrently 4 weeks ahead of schedule and below budget.”\n \nAbout Rapidmix\nThe Rapidmix 400CW plant produces high quality controlled mixtures for\nutilisation in a range of applications, including RCC (Roller Compacted\nConcrete), CTB (Cement Treated Base), soil stabilisation, soil cement,\nbentonite, marine dredging, mine backfill and many more. The mobile nature\nof the plant combined with the technically advanced design, is most\nadvantageous in meeting the supply and demand requirements on projects. The\nRapidmix provides a cost effective solution for on-site projects where high\nspecification compliance coupled with a high volume fast throughput are\nessential.\n\nFully mobile and self-contained, the Rapidmix 400CW is a complete plant\npowered by its own power source, with on-board compressor and generator.\nFitted with a self-erecting system, using hydraulics, the plant can change\nfrom travel mode to fully operational within a few hours. Available with\noutputs of up to 600 tonnes per hour, the Rapidmix provides feed rates that\nare fully adjustable for the aggregate, cement and water systems.\n\nT 028 38 840671\nwww.rapidinternational.com\n",

          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is incredibly proud to present Low and Bonar as its Performance Material Provider of the Month whilst telling its readership base more about the works of this exceptional company (focusing specifically on its premium product brand Adfil).\n\nLow and Bonar is a London-headquartered company that is globally renowned for its competency in providing high performance materials for the building & industrial, civil engineering, coated technical textiles, interiors and transportation sectors. Manufacturing plants and sales offices are based in Europe, North America, the Middle East, India and China.\n\nIts activities revolve around the development and supply of fibres, industrial/coated fabrics, composite materials and yarns using state-of-the-art technologies. With its suite of products, all engineered for each specific end-use, Low and Bonar assists businesses across the world to save water, generate cleaner air, encourage higher crop production and contribute to more comfortable working and leisure spaces.\n\nThe roots of the premium product brand Adfil date back to the early 90s targeting those working within the construction market with synthetic fibre reinforcements. The comprehensive Adfil product portfolio includes standard and custom-made fibres that are readily available in measured quantities.\n\n“We develop, manufacture and sell construction fibres to improve the durability of concrete,” summarised Manager of Technical Sales, Mark Mitchell, who is based at the company’s UK office in Hull. “Specifically focusing on additives for concrete, our customers tend to be ready mixed concrete producers, engineers and contractors.”\n\nDelivered in paper degradable bags, plastic bags, jumbo sacks or bulk boxes, the micro and macro synthetic fibre types are all developed in accordance with EN 14889 – 2:2006 (the EC Certificate of Conformity). The flexibility of this industry quality compliant range has attracted customers seeking solutions for various applications; the materials are frequently utilised for concrete floors, pattern imprinted concrete, precast concrete products and tunnelling (for example). \n\nThis popularity is largely because the advantages of using macro and micro fibres over traditional steel mesh reinforcement have become increasingly apparent over the years. The fibre alternatives help to improve impact, abrasion & shatter resistance whilst ensuring plastic shrinkage & settlement crack reductions. They also provide post-crack ductility, moderate waste and offer significant economic, social and environmental benefits.\n\nThe synthetic blends are also easier to handle than their conventional equivalents and offer asset longevity as well as, crucially, improved safety at the construction site. Building projects can be completed in a speedier manner and all works conducted help to reduce the site’s carbon footprint.\n\nLow and Bonar is committed to innovating and invests heavily in R&D in order to improve upon its offering. Internal and external tests at independent laboratory facilities ensure consistency and the company philosophy is centred on performance and the creation of customer value.\n\n“We are a progressive company that has been in the trade for over 100 years,” Mark concluded. “We manufacture products for construction fibres mainly in Belgium and have a sales team operating in the UK as well as a distribution network delivering solutions to customers in over 90 countries worldwide.”\n\nTo find out more about these materials please refer to the contact details provided.

          "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Business and Industry Today, we are pleased to announce AmiRose London Ltd as our Cosmetics & Skincare Company of the Month. Founded in 2010 by Jack Gordon, AmiRose London Ltd specialise in producing niche type skincare accessories and products. The company carries a number of ranges that are available in the UK, and all products are also available for export and private label.  With a team of seven staff based in Ilford, AmiRose London Ltd import and distribute beauty skincare cosmetics. As well as developing its own unique brands, the company also distribute other labelled brands, and over the years has supplied major supermarkets such as Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose and cosmetic outlets such as Boots, Superdrug, Holland & Barrett, Lloyds, plus pharmacies nationwide.  In such a crowded marketplace, AmiRose London Ltd work hard to make its products stand out, and Jack commented, “as a smaller company, we know that we have to be a little different, and more niche. From the outset, we aimed to specialise in developing products that customers could not find elsewhere.”   One of the first items that AmiRose London Ltd developed was eye pads that actually looked and smelled like real cucumber slices. Many other companies were offering eye pads to soothe tired eyes, but AmiRose made its product stand out from the rest by including a cucumber fragrance & printed image that the customer could enjoy upon opening the box. This, in addition to the unique and unusual appearance of the pads ensured that the company had its own place in the cosmetic sector.   These proved so popular with clients, that AmiRose London Ltd continued to develop such products in different ways. The company expanded this idea, and as well as the eye pads, these unique products have been developed into face masks too. If required, masks and pads can have bespoke logos added to them including company branding or pictures to make them especially distinctive.   In addition to this, the fragrance infused pads and masks have continued to develop, and customers can purchase products that smell of Watermelon, Green Tea or even Oranges among other things, It is these innovations that have ensure AmiRose London Ltd remain leaders in innovation  It is not just skincare that you get from Amirose, it is spotting a gap in the market that people are looking for and we found that Snoring is a major problem in over 70% relationships. We have recently developed a nasal dilater snore-relief product called Snore Stop. Made from medical grade silicone and with strategically placed magnets to help keep the device in place, this is very simple to use. Once inserted the airways are much clearer, and each dilator comes with a hygienic carry case for storage or travel, and every box gives a 28-day supply.  Recently, AmiRose London Ltd has been producing more products for the men’s hair and skin care market, including products for thinning hair. These are fibres that when shaken or sprayed on will immediately cover a thin or bald spot on the head. This will remain in place until washed out - results have to be seen to be believed.  As it looks to the future, the company is developing a range of biodegradable hair clips and brushes. Understanding that both the company and its customers are looking for more sustainable products, AmiRose London Ltd is launching these new products soon and is hoping for them to slot into the market very successfully. In conclusion, Jack mentioned, “although COVID-19 was a tough time, we battled through it thanks to improving our online presence, and we spent time developing new products. We hope that customers will benefit from these as we move into the future.”  For more information:  T 020 8559 8244jack@amirose.comwww.amirose.com",

          "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Business and Industry Today, we are pleased to announce Challenge Coins UK as our Challenge Coins Company of the Month.Established and run by former serviceman Tom Newey, Challenge Coins UK stems from the United States Army tradition where a ‘Commanders Coin’ is formally presented to military personnel in recognition of excellence in competitions or service. Tom’s career in the British Armed Forces began upon completion of basic training at ATR Bassingbourn before joining the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and beginning training as an Aircraft Technician at Arborfield. Once trained Tom was posted to 3 Regiment Army Air Corps at Wattisham Airfield, an Apache helicopter unit. After spending long periods of time on exercise in America, Tom was given his first Challenge Coin whilst on exercise in Southern California by a US Navy Blue Angels display team technician. After swapping some patches for the coin, Tom felt his unit needed a coin to swap with the Americans. An initial batch of coins were made and sold in under two weeks, and Challenge Coins UK was born. A huge benefit to Challenge Coins UK’s service is that by having experienced the forces first hand, the company really understands how important recognition is, not just in the armed forces, but through any form of service. Based in Northwich, Cheshire, Challenge Coins UK has supplied over 180,000 coins to units throughout the Armed Forces and Emergency Services in the UK and around the world including SQN Army Air Corps, Irish National Police, South Wales Police, Cervus Defence, JTAC, Warfare Training Group, and many more. Proudly veteran owned, we asked Tom what the benefits of their service are, he answered, “we like to think we are setting the standard of challenge coins in the UK. The overall quality of the end product and our customer service is second to none. Our efficient, fast and reliable service means that we can have an enquiry that comes in at 12pm on a Monday and by 12pm on a Tuesday the order can be fully invoiced and placed into production. The coin itself is made to the highest quality, and it resembles something far greater than just a gift card so to speak. A coin lasts forever, it’s like a medal, there’s a lot of pride that goes into receiving such a gift. Also it’s a great way for a company to look back on and remember the milestones it has achieved over the years by marking them with a custom-made Challenge Coin.”A Challenge Coin has become increasingly more popular now within the corporate world, as the concept and tradition has evolved from the military to large companies who are now using the idea and product to honour members of staff for their services, mark senior leadership or company milestones. “We had a large influx of corporate customers throughout COVID-19 who wanted to show their appreciation to their staff by commending them and we received orders of up to 10,000 Challenge Coins. It put us in a really healthy position going forward and also increased our brand awareness. We are vastly merging into the corporate sector as the concept of Challenge Coins is quickly building momentum,” mentioned Tom.If you’re a business, military unit or even involved in the education sector looking to commend a person, unit or occasion, see below for more information on how Challenge Coins UK can help you.T 0333 335 1012sales@challengecoinsuk.comwww.challengecoinsuk.com",

We are ready to heavily invest in onboarding, high-quality acquisition talent managers across the country and further into Europe.

Even though COVID-19 inevitably had a huge impact on the industry, Craig believes the company has managed to come out stronger because of its strong client reputation. “COVID-19 was tricky to navigate, it was very tough.

However, we are in full control for continuous growth,” said Craig.It’s a true testament to Craig and each member of the team to not only to have endured such unprecedented times but to have come out stronger and more successful.

          "DetailDescription": "Art is often about capturing thoughts or experiences into a medium and\ndisplaying it for the world to enjoy. For Steve Porter at Signed99, art\nseems to be a celebration of those little experiences. What’s more, Steve\nhas managed to create an exclusive collection of exquisite art that is\naffordable - something that is extremely rare in the world of art.With prices starting from £1 and incrementally rising to £1 million,\nSigned99 has created 99 exclusive, unique art commissions for sale. Steve’s\nwork turns the notion of traditional portraits on its head by painting his\nclient’s signatures twice to create a balance and harmony within the piece.Steve Porter noted that his rationale behind these concepts was, “because\neveryone in the world has a name. This is the perfect product for a world\nculture that champions our individualism.”It is clear that Signed99 will be using a dynamic pricing structure to make\nquality, contemplative art available for everyone - regardless of the\nnumber in their bank account. What’s more, each commission will come with\nfree delivery and a complimentary bottle of Champagne to celebrate the\nreceipt of the new art piece.Steve said, “This is something to celebrate yourself with - to celebrate\nlife with. The champagne is so everyone can enjoy a taste of the high\nlife.”With only 99 commissions being made, the first ten will be priced at under\n£500, with the first twenty costing less than £1,000. This is to make sure\nthese beautiful pieces of art will be available for all.A great deal of thought, care and planning has gone into the concepts\nsurrounding Signed99 and the commissioned pieces. For Steve, it is all\nabout giving people the room to enjoy themselves - which perfectly ties\ninto the theme of Signed99.As Steve noted, “There is nothing wrong with feeling good about yourself\nand enjoying yourself.”For more information about Signed99, or to enquire about a commission,\nplease visit: www.signed99.com or contact Steve Porter on +44 (0)7769667487 or email: info@steveporter.org\n",

          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is proud to announce that Nature’s Creations\nhas received our CBD Company of the Year award, for its Huna brand of high\nquality products.\n\nThe popularity of CBD has skyrocketed over the last few years. With so many\ndifferent ranges and options on the market, it can be difficult to identify\nproducts which are authentic, high quality, and likely to make a\ndifference.\n\nSo, why choose Huna CBD products? The answer lies in their ingredients.\nContaining 100% pure CBD, Huna’s products follow a meticulous CO2\nextraction process, maintaining precise control over the heat and pressure\nto produce the exact compounds needed. This means Huna can manage the\npurity of the cannabinoids to bring perfectly pure, finely tuned and 100%\nnatural CBD products to its portfolio. Such control means that anyone using\nthe products only get what they need, without the risk of consuming any\nunnecessary chemicals and their resultant side effects.\n\nAnother testament to Huna’s quality is the fact that its products are the\nresult of a deeply personal journey. When a close family member came up\nagainst serious health challenges in 2017, Founder Craig Hamilton began\nresearch and discovered how CBD can help to support wellbeing and a healthy\nlifestyle. After realising that high quality and authentic CBD products\nwere incredibly difficult to find, Craig took matters into his own hands.\n\nSince then, Craig set up Huna to help make high strength and high quality\nCBD products available to the UK market. “There are a lot of low-quality\nproducts out there, with companies selling oils and capsules with a low\npercentage that don’t really do anything. I know from personal experience\nthat good quality CBD can make a big difference. Once I’d had a look at the\nindustry and attended some trade shows, I saw there was a big gap in the\nmarket for 100% natural and high-quality CBD oil.\n\n“Everything we make is from distillate oil extract. Many other companies\nfurther process the oil into powder, because it’s a lot cheaper, but there\nare so many reports that say CBD in this form isn’t worth it. This can\noften be why some people try it and say it doesn’t have any effect, because\nthey’re not getting proper products.”\n\nIn contrast, buying from Huna means investing in a product which will do\nexactly what it’s meant to do. “I’ve always made sure that if it says 400mg\non the bottle, then it has to contain at least that, if not more. I’d\nprefer to give people more than what they pay for, to make sure they’re\ngetting real value for money and feel the benefits of the products they\nuse.”\n\nIn fact, Craig was recently contacted by Isabelle, who picked up a sample\nof Huna’s 6% CBD oil at a trade show along with a 20% strength bottle from\nanother company. After using the 20% oil for a couple of weeks, she didn’t\nexperience any effects, so tried Huna’s 6% oil instead. “She called me up\nand told me that she felt the benefits within just a couple of days. The\nfact that she felt such immediate effects from our lowest strength oil, but\nnothing from the other company’s higher strength product, really shows to\nme that we are offering premium quality products. Isabelle owns a coffee\nshop up in Yorkshire where she also sells health products, and she’ll now\nbe stocking Huna products as well.”\n\nHuna is certainly determined to not only meet but set the standards of the\nCBD industry. As big supporters of governance, testing and verification,\nHuna is a member of the Cannabis Trade Association and The British Hemp\nAssociation, ensuring all of its products adhere to their guidelines and\nexceed testing requirements. “You can find the lab reports for all of our\nproducts on our website, which prove their adherence to these guidelines\nand show how our products are over and above the percentage they’re\nrequired to be.”\n\nThis commitment to quality is being recognised across the industry. “We’ve\nstarted shipping products to a large wholesaler who will get our products\nout to more places. We’ve also been in discussion with a doctor who runs an\nonline pharmacy. He tried the CBD oil and really liked it, experienced\namazing benefits from it. He’s got 100,000 subscribers and wants to send an\nemail shot of our products to all of his customers, so that’s really\npositive for us.\n\n“Things are starting to move forward again after everything stalled due to\nCOVID-19. Things are definitely picking up, and we’re now looking at\nsorting out some special Christmas packages that will make great presents.\nOne for fitness and sport, and one for calm and relaxation. There will also\nbe different sizes at different prices, so people can still experience CBD\nno matter what their budget.”\n\nAfter the challenges of this year, which are looking set to continue for\nthe foreseeable future, many of us could benefit from Huna’s premium CBD\nproducts. Self-care is essential in looking after our wellbeing and\nsupporting our health, and incorporating these products into our daily\nlives can bring about incredible results.\n\nReady to find out more?

          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is proud to announce that Salix Finance has been selected as our Energy Efficiency Finance Company of the Month.\n\n\n\nEnergy-efficient and low carbon technologies are essential for the future of our planet, and Salix is helping the public sector to access such technologies by providing interest-free Government funding for energy efficiency projects. The savings made from such installations can be used to pay back the loan, and once this is repaid, they can then be used to finance other resources within the organisation or further energy efficiency projects.\n\n\n\nIndeed, with the growing support for a post-COVID ‘green recovery’, the need for these technologies has never been more pressing. Thanks to funding from Salix Finance, the public sector can focus on ‘no regret measures’, allowing organisations to concentrate on improving energy efficiency as part of measures to install net-zero initiatives, such as solar power. \n\n\n\nOne such organisation is Nottingham City Council (NCC), which is working to become the UK’s first Carbon Neutral City by 2028 (https://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/cn2028). This mission was recently recognised after NCC’s Energy Services won the East Midlands category of the 2020 Regional or Local Authority Body of the Year Awards, in recognition of its true commitment to promoting energy efficiency within its region.\n\n\n\nFunding from Salix has played a significant role in NCC Energy Services’ continued investment in energy efficiency measures. Over the last financial year, the council has completed various projects including LED replacements and control measures. During 2019/2020 these lighting projects would equate to an estimated reduction of over 75 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year and over £642,747 over the project’s lifetime. NCC Energy Services also invested in heating projects, including replacing boilers, control systems and heat recovery, which has accounted for lifetime cost savings of over £173,744.\n\n\n\nThese measures have enabled the council to reduce expenditure on estate running costs while maintaining service delivery to residents. What’s more, the long-term financial savings have been spread across the authority including to protect frontline services, which have been even more crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n“Salix Finance has been outstanding in providing practical guidance on a technical and project level that is clear and concise. This support has always been forthcoming and has enabled the authority to deliver a wide range of projects that are having a significant and measurable impact in energy and carbon savings across the estate. This is setting a positive outlook for the future and I’ll look forward to continuing to work with Salix.” – Patrick Heron, Energy Projects Officer, NCC Energy Services.\n\n\n\nYou can find out more about NCC Energy Services here: www.energyservices-ncc.co.uk\n\n\n\nSalix funding is available for over 100 eligible energy-efficient technologies, and clients can apply for more than one technology per application. As a strong advocate for knowledge sharing, Salix Finance has a free knowledge share area on its website where current and potential clients can access various case studies and download the tools they need to make an application. \n\n\n\nAs the UK begins its recovery from what’s been a tumultuous year, Salix will be continuing to work in partnership with the public sector to help ensure a more energy-efficient future, reducing carbon emissions across the sector in line with the UK’s carbon targets.

Similarly, in service businesses we’ve helped\nto create best practice ‘sales to order’ processes and created error-\nproofed billing systems.”\n\nALC has been working with a manufacturer of industrial metal goods for the\npast 18 months.  “When we started the place was chaotic with piles of part\nbuilt products blocking aisles, people busily fixing things and a general\nfeeling of disorganised urgency. We worked with a team from across the\nbusiness to map the order to delivery processes, developed a production\nmethod linked back to customer demand and created a simple scheduling\nsystem based around Lean best practice.\n\nCore to the success here has been the engagement of the team and their\ninvolvement in ‘owning’ the change. The result is that lead times have been\nreduced by several weeks, finished goods inventory has been slashed, WIP is\na fraction of what it was before and on-time delivery is the best ever.”\n\nALC boasts a team with over 20 years’ experience in applying Lean thinking\nto business situations across a vast range of companies, including those\nworking in automotive, construction, electronics, construction materials,\nmanufacturing, supply chain, warehousing and office processes.\n“Our approach is to ‘coach’, not tell,” Tim elaborated. “We help clients\nunderstand how Lean can help them through demonstration, coaching and the\napplication of best practice. Ultimately, we do ourselves out of a job: our\nclient’s performance has risen to the point where they don’t need us\nanymore!”\n\nAs part of its services, ALC offers a fixed price audit, following an order\nthrough the processes between order receipt and despatch identifying areas\nfor improvement, quick wins and detailing how we can help.\n\nAs well as this, ALC runs Lean seminars that demonstrate Lean thinking and\nhow, through the simple application of Lean theory, we can help slash lead\ntime, increase quality, reduce WIP and improve productivity.\n\nALC maintains a busy calendar of events throughout the year, including\nSouthern Manufacturing & Electronics in Farnborough and Northern\nManufacturing & Electronics in Manchester. The company has also attended\nshows and exhibitions in the Milton Keynes area. “We like to be able to\nmeet potential customers, discuss how their businesses are faring and\nunderstand how to help them through coaching and the application of Lean\ntheory,” concluded Tim.\n\nIf you would like to find out more information on ALC’s full range of\nservices, head to the website or get in touch using the contact details\nbelow.\n\nM +44 (0)7411 381887\ninfo@appliedleanconsulting.com\nwww.appliedleanconsulting.com\n",

In a drive to transform the road marking sector they are finding better and more importantly safer ways of working.\n\nExisting methods of pre-marking for road markings has not changed since its inception, it is a slow and labour-intensive activity. The process involves operatives or the client’s engineers, calculating where the road markings should be, walking the route with a measuring wheel and bending over to mark with aerosol paint. This process has several inherent safety risks, especially people plant interface issues as well as potential back injuries. \n\nTo manage these risks, improve productivity and save on cost, WJ collaborating with a European partner introduced the first ever ROBOT into the road marking sector. \n\nCompletely autonomous, using GNSS for its navigation, the robotic technology has transformed pre-marking, proving to be safe, more accurate, much faster and ideal for the task.

          "Description": "Food and Drink Matters is proud to announce that Inginius has been selected as our Gin Specialist Company of the Year.",
          "DetailDescription": "Food and Drink Matters is proud to announce that Inginius has been selected as our Gin Specialist Company of the Year. For the past few years, Inginius has been committed to providing the finest quality hand-crafted tonic waters, designed to enhance and complement the growing range of artisanal gins. They are also now developing their product range in order to provide the growing number of gin enthusiasts with fresh, clean and altogether exquisitely blended tonics which are proving extremely popular with consumers.\n\nThe market for artisanal gins seems to be expanding exponentially, and it goes without saying that (almost) every gin needs its tonic. This is where Inginius comes in. The company was founded in 2016 by Andrew Peerless; despite not having a background in the food and drink industry, having 40 years’ experience in publishing and the book trade, he is an enthusiastic consumer of gin and loves cooking and entertaining. These hobbies provided a basis for his idea for Inginius, which occurred to him whilst he was still working at Oxford University Press. Andrew noticed the growing appreciation for artisanal gins and understood they needed a range of delicately balanced tonics to complement them. Indeed, the gin industry is ever increasing, which has resulted in a fast developing market for tonic waters.\n\nWe had the pleasure of speaking to Andrew about the development of his business, and the work he has put in to create such fine quality products: 'It took a while to find out about tonic water development', he says. 'I was terrified of developing my own tonic at first, as there seemed to be so many complexities and difficulties to overcome, but I threw myself into it with some enthusiasm, and found a small company in London to work with who could help me to develop the recipes.' Andrew worked with this company for a short time before encountering some problems: 'There were some issues with the second batch this company produced, so I bit the bullet and created a small trial run myself. I blended all the ingredients and had it bottled commercially at a bottling plant in Dudley. That worked out extremely well, and so I’ve worked with the company ever since. It’s quite a labour-intensive process but I think the results – the subtlety and depth of the flavours, the gentle effervescence, the way the tonics  support and enhance the gins – make it all worthwhile.'\n\nOriginally based in the West Country, Inginius moved to Oxford in early 2018, where the handmade tonics are now created before they are bottled at a specialist facility in Dudley. These tonic waters are made from natural ingredients and are designed to accompany an extensive range of gins. The focus is on complementing rather than overpowering the delicate flavours of the hand-crafted, artisanal gins that are available in the marketplace. Andrew uses small-batch production methods, steeping real fruit peel before mixing in other ingredients in order to create a clean and fresh taste. All of the ingredients are the finest available and are carefully weighed and selected by hand, ensuring the products are created with the sharpest attention to detail.\n\nInginius currently has two tonics, with a selection of new blends being released in April. The Classic tonic is crisp, clean, and refreshing and is blended for pairing with (London) dry gins. It has less sugar (6.4g per 100ml), a little less quinine and lower carbonation than other equivalent tonics and has no artificial sweeteners. It is the perfect mixer to enjoy with premium and small-batch gins made with distinctive botanicals. It is an excellent combination with many London dry gins, but makes an exceptional companion to gins such as Malfy, Monkey 47, Copperhead, Cotswold Dry, Garden Swift from Capreolus Distillery, Chase Williams Elegance, Dutch Courage from Holland, and 9 Moons from Martin Millers.\n\nTheir other tonic is the Citrus Sweet, which was developed to complement sweeter gins, and gins with distinct citrus or floral elements. These tonics can also be delicious on their own with ice and a dash of bitters, creating the perfect option for the designated driver. The Citrus Sweet tonic has rich citrus and botanical ingredients, but no more sugar than the Classic. It combines elegantly with a variety of sweeter gins, but is especially good with Worsley Gin from Manchester, Brockmans, Chase Williams Pink Grapefruit and Pomello gin, and Rhubarb and Ginger gins from Whitley Neil and Edinburgh.\n\nThe excellent qualities of these tonics were recently proven by Inginius’s success at the Great Taste Awards 2018. Great Taste is the renowned benchmark for the finest food and drink and is often described as the Oscars of the food world, or the culinary equivalent of the Man Booker Prize. Over 500 judges joined together for 65 judging days between March and July 2018, where they blind-tasted thousands of products in teams of three or four to ensure a mix of age, gender and expertise. The Great Taste logo is trusted throughout the food and drink industry, and is a sure sign of high quality for any product which boasts its mark. After an extensive judging process, Inginius’s Citrus Sweet range was awarded one star, which is only achieved by 25% of entries, and it means the judges thought the tonic waters were ‘simply delicious’ and delivered excellent flavour. On top of this, the Classic range was awarded two stars. Less than 15% of entries receive this rating, and it means the judges believed the tonics were ‘outstanding’. Andrew was told that it was ‘extremely rare’ for a product to receive 2 stars on first submission, proving that it must be exceptional.\n\nAndrew told us that winning these awards 're-invigorated the whole business', and he is looking to release four more blends of tonic waters in April to expand his range. With these new blends, Andrew is hoping to cater for the health conscious consumer, and has been working with a new sweetener which is derived from apples. This sweetener is a by-product of pectin production, meaning it also helps to reduce waste. By using this, Inginius can offer a light version of their tonic waters sweetened with fruit sugars which doesn’t mar their excellent taste, and maintains the balance of flavours with the gins they are paired with.\n\nOne of these new blends, the Berry Light, has been developed in conjunction with a fine locally distilled gin called Skywave. This is the first time Inginius has blended a tonic with the aim of highlighting specific botanicals in a gin, and it will be Skywave’s tonic of choice when it is released in April. Skywave is a light, fresh gin with a citrus burst and spicy finish, hand-crafted using small-batch methods for passionate gin drinkers and these flavours will only be enhanced by the addition of Inginius’s Berry Light tonic water. Andrew also hopes that this new blend will pair well with many other gins that have a similar botanical or flavour profile to Skywave.\n\nInginius already strives to ensure their tonic waters are as natural as they can be, and are looking to use organically certified ingredients in the future to make their drinks healthier as well as delicious. With an ever growing number of health-conscious consumers, Inginius is striving to provide a range of tonic waters that can be enjoyed without the negative health effects. As well as looking to break into the healthy lifestyle market, Andrew is also working on increasing the number of premium establishments selling the tonics. 'Whilst Inginius is new to the market, I believe my product range is distinctive and I’m keen to talk to wholesalers about selling the tonics. I’m offering a unique product for the high-end market and I’ve started to take on numerous influential restaurants to help get the brand name out there.'\n\nIndeed, Inginius has welcomed plenty of excellent new customers, including the Quod Restaurant on Oxford High Street, which will be including the Inginius tonic waters in their new drinks menu from March. The tonics are also served at The Oxford Kitchen on Banbury Road, Oxford, a Michelin-starred restaurant which serves classic British dishes with a modern twist. 'One of our other latest customers is The Stag and Huntsman in the beautiful village of Hambledon, near Henley in Oxfordshire. I should also mention the Cotswold Plough Hotel in Clanfield, who have been terrifically supportive. They distil their own gins and are enormously enthusiastic supporters of Inginius.' As well as being served in bars and pubs, Inginius’s tonic waters can also be found in several shops, including the Hop Pocket Wine Shop, Herefordshire, and Eynsham Cellars, Oxfordshire. This is in addition to the tonics being available to purchase on Amazon or directly from Inginius’s website.\n\nIn March, Inginius will be heading to Glasgow for the Gin to My Tonic Show at the Glasgow Exhibition Centre, which will feature four sessions that provide the opportunity to network with gin enthusiasts. It will include gin and cocktail bars, cocktail masterclasses, blind taste challenges, and presentations from distilleries, allowing attendees to discover and taste new brands and product ranges. This will be an excellent opportunity for Inginius to promote their high quality tonic waters to thousands of gin lovers. At a similar event in Liverpool last year, Andrew was struck by the enthusiasm that people showed for his tonics, managing to sell all the stock he had taken with him, so he is looking forward to meeting even more people in Glasgow. 'I don’t do a lot of shows, but I did attend the Copenhagen Festival recently. It’s claimed that this is the biggest gin event in Europe, and it was certainly very busy. My Danish distributor had a stand, and he was very happy with the results of the show. I will also have a stand at Junipalooza in London in June, which I’m very much looking forward to because I will have the new range of tonics by then too.'\n\nIn the coming months, Inginius is looking to take on even more influential restaurants to help get the brand name out into the public domain, focusing on high-end establishments to promote the premium flavours of the tonics. Inginius is also aiming to sharpen up their brand image. Working with an external designer, Andrew is developing new designs for his website and product labels, which will be ready to coincide with the release of the new range of tonic waters in April. To ensure his product range is always developing to suit the needs of their customers, Andrew is also developing a gift set with Skywave gin, to provide a unique present for the gin enthusiast, along with Ginfusion botanicals. Ginfusion mixes can be put into your glass, infusing with the gin and providing an extra zing of flavour to enhance the classic beverage.\n\nThe popularity of Britain’s most-loved spirit does not seem to be waning, with new small-batch distilleries starting up all over the country. With Inginius’s supreme, hand-crafted tonics, you are sure to find the perfect companion to your favourite premium gin.

          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is proud to announce that ExaClair Ltd has been chosen to receive our Stationery Company of the Year Award. As the UK subsidiary for the Exacompta-Clairefontaine Group, ExaClair boasts centuries of experience in its sector, with their earliest brand, Herbin, dating back to 1670. With this heritage and unparalleled expertise, ExaClair can be counted upon to deliver unrivalled excellence across its 10 high quality brands. \n\nAs one of the only European paper manufacturers to have full control of the paper throughout the process, from pulp to the finished product, ExaClair can be counted on to produce premium and innovative products for an extensive range of applications. Manufactured in their King’s Lynn factory, ExaClair’s products are distributed throughout the UK as well as being shipped to their European distribution centre in France to supply customers across Europe.\n\nWith sustainability dominating the public consciousness over the past few years, ExaClair is fully invested in developing their environmentally friendly products even further. We had the pleasure of speaking to Clement Rouillard, Marketing Manager, who told us about ExaClair’s mission for sustainability. 'ExaClair has been ‘green’ forever; our eco-friendly range, Exacompta Forever, has been established for decades. It was initially comprised of paper-based products made from recycled materials, and then we expanded into desk accessories made from post-consumer plastics; we are committed to reducing the amount of waste plastic in the environment.' This range is fully Blue Angel® certified, meaning we are re-using post-consumer waste to manufacture the products. The Forever PP range reuse plastic bottles as raw material for the manufacturing of the desktop and filing ranges.\n\nAnother key value for ExaClair Ltd is its unwavering dedication to innovation; even though it is difficult to continue to innovate within the stationery industry, ExaClair consistently rises to the challenge, launching 50-60 new products every year and currently boasting a catalogue with over 18,000 products. \n\nOne such innovation is their Tiny Rolls, which won two awards at the London Stationery Show this year, including the coveted 'Judges’ Choice' Award which recognises creative thinking, clarity and impact in delivering a product and 'Best Gift Packaging' Award. 'It is a simple idea which has taken off very quickly,' Clement explained. 'The Tiny Rolls are made of Blue Angel certified craft paper with funky designs, and are of a shorter length, meaning they can conveniently fit into any handbag.' A further example of ExaClair’s innovation is their range of Koverbook notebooks from Clairefontaine, which feature two bookmark flaps that can be used as a pocket to store loose documents. 'We also do our best to use innovative engineering processes, creating our products using less materials and therefore making them more eco-friendly like in our Iderama filing range from Exacompta.'\n\nFinally, Clement told us some of ExaClair’s exciting future plans. 'We are constantly looking to increase the number of green products we sell, so we will continue to expand this range. The group is also in the process of developing a range of carbon-neutral products in order to further contribute to a more sustainable future. We have another exciting development happening in the next few months as well; from the end of July, we will be supplying a range of notebooks and ring-binders to Morrison’s for the back-to-school market, which is the first time our products will be exposed to the mass consumer, so we are thrilled!'\n\nFor more information on their full range of products and sustainable elements, head to their website or get in touch using the details below.\n\nT 01553 696600\nwww.exaclairlimited.com",

It is handmade in Lincolnshire in the UK and is popular in the UK and Australia, with growing demand in Europe and the USA. It has an extremely high success rate. In a recent survey 94% of respondents found it to be successful at stopping their dogs from pulling & 96% would recommend it.\n\nUnlike other training halters, the point of control is behind the dog’s head. This means that the K9 Bridle doesn’t ride up over the dog’s eyes or mouth or twist the neck, keeping the dog’s spine in line. It is made from a lightweight tubular webbing with no hard edges and is soft, comfortable and safe. It can help to control dog aggression and very little strength is required to use the K9 Bridle, making it ideal for people with disabilities.\n\nColin Spender, Master Dog Trainer with the Guild of Dog Trainers, commented, 'Having seen the immediate effect of the K9 Bridle on a Great Dane that pulled severely, I recommend them to all my clients.'\n\nLynn Gibney, Head Trainer at Laleham DTC, said, 'I always recommend the K9 Bridle for any dog that pulls on the lead.

          "DetailDescription": "The University of Manchester is the largest single-site university in the UK and part of the prestigious Russell Group.\n\nThe challenge\nThe University of Manchester recently took the decision to invest in new desks for lecturers, but a number of specific requirements made this a difficult task, as Jamie Wright, media services assistant manager, at the university, explains, ‘We struggled to find something that would have all the abilities that we wanted: electrically height adjustable, the right size, which for us is shallower than a normal depth of desk, the ability to incorporate a 19’’ rack and customisable. We really struggled to find anywhere else on the market that could provide that. Thankfully when we came to Loxit, they managed to find a good solution.’\n\nThe project\nAfter meeting with Loxit, the university discovered we were able to design and install desks that met their requirements.\n\n‘One of the interesting things we found was that the type of mechanics we’ve got actually suited the university’s requirements but being a shallow desk, which was actually based on the depth of a plinth, and needing the integrated AV meant that it had to have a certain type of electrically height adjustable leg set,’ explains John Whittle.\n\nFollowing the design review after the first rollout, the requirement to have a split vanity panel at the back was introduced. This means that IT can go into a room mid-lecture if a piece of equipment goes down, remove the portion of the vanity panel and access the back of the rack to do the servicing while the lecture continues to be delivered.\n\nJamie Wright adds, ‘Generally when it comes to AV support there’s only one technician who’ll fix the issue, so instead of having to take off an entire vanity panel they can take off the section they need, which is just behind the rack, and get to all the equipment. That’s been really useful for us as opposed to having to get a couple of people in to take off whole vanity panels at once.’ In addition to this, two-thirds height doors allow lecturers to access some of the components but ensure they’re not able to reach everything.\n\nThe outcome\nThe bespoke Loxit desks have now been installed across the University of Manchester’s campus.\n\n‘It’s become part of our teaching standard. We have the same kit and the same layout in 85 of our centrally timetabled rooms which makes it really useful for the lecturers because no matter where they are on campus it’s the same equipment and the same layout,’ says Jamie Wright, UoM.\n\n‘When lecturers come to use the equipment, not only the AV equipment but also the features of the desk like the raise and lower, they know where everything is located. It’s been really useful for us to be able to standardise on this product. It’s also actually had unexpected uses which we hadn’t planned for but it’s been delivered really well. We started out with one particular product and through several iterations, which we worked on with Loxit, we’ve come up with a really good product which we feel we can roll out across our entire campus.’\n\nThe Impact\nThe height adjustment has been a particularly popular feature, having a number of unexpected benefits.\n\n‘In addition to providing easy access and comfort for wheelchair users or those who have difficulty standing for long periods, we’ve also found that the height adjustment has been very useful for some of our other users, such as our maths lecturers who want the desk to be raised quite high so they can use the visualisers,’ says Jamie Wright, UoM\n\nBefore we got the desks, lecturers were having to spend a good hour, sometimes even two, leant over writing formulae on the visualisers and we were getting a lot of complaints about people with bad backs. Having these desks has made it really easy for lecturers to be able to utilise things like the visualiser without causing any serious damage to their back, so it’s actually had unexpected uses which we hadn’t planned for but it’s been delivered really well.’\n\nT +44 (0)1625 856801\nsales@loxit.com\nwww.loxit.com",

The company was originally set up to provide work for blind people in Norwich, within a holistic setting which provided accommodation and services for living. Over the years, the working element of this service moved premises and became a part of Norfolk County Council’s Community Services Department. Then, in November 2013, many of the services within Community Services externalised into a Community Interest Company called Independence Matters, of which Norfolk Industries is a part.\n\nCommercially, Norfolk Industries manufactures recycled bedding products for small animals, including recycled paper bedding, chewy tubes, award-winning animal houses, and cotton bedding. Norfolk Industries recycles 140 tonnes of waste every year, and is dedicated to helping the environment. In fact, they have also recently developed award-winning plastic free product lines, with materials being packaged in paper bags rather than plastic. What’s more, their cotton bedding uses non-viscose material, meaning it has short fibres and therefore does not cause the animal harm if it is swallowed, unlike viscose fibre.\n\nOver the last five years, Norfolk Industries has continued to develop its commercial market and products now supplying numerous larger companies in the UK, as well as exporting their products to Spain. In fact, 90% of their customers are made up of large suppliers of pet products, with Norfolk Industries’ manufacturing under various big name brands. The company also has its own brand, which can be found on Ebay and on the Norfolk Industries website. “Our next mission is to break into the garden centre market,’ explains General Manager Sharon Tooke, ‘to help the business continue its impressive growth.’\n\nThe other side of the company involves offering employment for people with disabilities, as well as work placements for people who have barriers to work. ‘Any surplus we make is re-invested back into the business; we are entirely dedicated to the community and helping people,’ says Sharon. The company is committed to demonstrating that people with disabilities are capable of contributing to a business, it just takes a little time to find out what they are capable of. Then, Norfolk Industries uses these strengths within the day to day operations of the business, therefore ensuring these individuals are making valuable contributions to all aspects of the company. The business also provides contract packing services which have proven useful in offering other work task options to people who do not suit the production line environment. This work includes electrical component and education toy packing. During the 12 month period to 31 March 2019, Norfolk Industries supported a total of 40 people either in employment or through work placement services. \n\nLast year, Norfolk Industries became involved in the EVOLVE work placement and development programme, in order to help disadvantaged individuals get closer to employment. What’s more, the company has been nominated by its parent company in the Autism Awards 2019 as an employer of those with disabilities. \n\nIf you would like to find out more information on their pet bedding supplies and what the company stands for, head to their website or get in touch using the contact details below.\n\nT 01603 667957\nsales@norfolkindustries.co.uk\nwww.norfolkindustries.co.uk",

Best Tube To truly is doing amazing work in helping people from all walks of life navigate the confusing and fast-paced world of the London Underground system, while keeping travellers up to date with what’s going on around the city on their social media!\n\nIt’s a safe bet to say that almost all, if not all of our readers have, at least once, visited the bustling and magical capital city of England: the Big Smoke (that’s London). It is also likely that everyone who has visited London has had to, at some point, use the London Underground system, or as it is better known: the Tube, total 249 miles of sprawling track, twisting and turning connecting the four corners of London. \n\nWhile the Tube is really quite an impressive spectacle, whichever way you look at it; from an engineering viewpoint, logistically, and how it is staffed and kept running so efficiently, it has to be said: navigating the London Underground can be a deeply confusing endeavour. Even the sight of the iconic tube map can be known to induce dread in the most seasoned of travellers. I must admit, when I first travelled to London the entire experience left me puzzled; the labyrinth of walkways and tunnels in stations; changing stations; finding the right exits and entrances. Even if you know the London Underground like the back of your hand, the entire experience can be a giant stress with the often considerable congestion (last year Transport for London recorded over 500,000 journeys in a single day).\n\nThis is where Best Tube To come in, the family run company established in 2017 putting an end to the confusion often associated with London Underground travel. The team at Best Tube To have created an extremely useful mobile-friendly website, available in nine languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin, Russian, and Arabic), with the aim of giving users easy to understand and straightforward directions for travel on the London Underground. Oh, and it is absolutely free! The user needs only to input their outward tube station and their desired tube station destination and the platform gives the user all the information they need to get from one station to another. This includes directions around the stations themselves, where to wait on the platform, how many stops there are until the desired destination is reached, and the accessibility of the stations (including information regarding lifts and how many stairs are to be climbed in each station).\n\nEven better, the team at Best Tube To are releasing an app very soon, allowing users even more ease in travelling across London. With 50,000 tourists visiting London every day, Best Tube To is absolutely the ideal solution, especially given the range of languages Best Tube To is available in. If you ever plan on using the London Underground, this is the platform for you, saving the user both time and allowing for a peace of mind – something you can’t put a price on! \n\nT 020 7501 8516\nterry@besttubeto.co.uk\nwww.besttubeto.co.uk\nwww.facebook.com/BestTubeTo\nwww.twitter.com/BestTubeTo\nwww.instagram.com/besttubeto\n",

It is a great way to get children away from screens, out and about and looking at their surroundings.

Our current additional sets include: Car Journey, Happy Campers, Supermarket, Shapes and Colours, Beside The Seaside, At The Park and Christmas.\n\nThe target age range for the game is 3+. For younger children, the idea behind the game is to simply search for the objects displayed on the magnets, and turn the magnets over once the objects are found. For older children, the game could be made into a competition wherein they race to find the objects and provide evidence, where appropriate.\n\nIf you would like to become a ‘SEEKERS’ stockist and would like further information, simply call 01257 450207, email: info@seekersgames.co.uk or visit: www.seekersgames.co.uk\n\nContacts: Sarah Le Marquand and Julia Power, the ‘SEEKERS’ team.\n",

          "DetailDescription": "Workboat UK quickly established themselves as a professional, honest and expert marine boat and pontoon hire service over their relatively short operating time. And at Business and Industry Today we’re always on the lookout for businesses that offer more, and so with no hesitation we decided to profile Workboat UK as our Vehicle Hire Company of the Month.\n\nWorkboat UK was established in 2017 by owner and Managing Director John Hitchcock with the aim to offer an honest and professional marine boat and pontoon hire service. Based in Aberdeen, Workboat UK works alongside the long established and hugely respected Caley Marine, itself based in Inverness and owned by Managing Director Jamie Hogan.\n\nJohn and his team pride themselves on offering a professional customer focused approach. They take time to understand every client’s hiring needs before offering the best solution, and the equipment supplied is some of the more robust and fully equipped marine boats available – the Norwegian Pioner series.\n\nWe had the opportunity to speak with John Hitchcock and he explained what separates Workboat UK from the competition along with a little more about his company.\n\n'I wanted to offer a customer focused service to clients looking to hire marine equipment.  We’re dedicated to offering clear and accurate advice that fits in with a customer’s exact need. Increasingly clients want more than just a product; they need to know they’ve been listened to and the advice they’ve been offered is sound.'\n\n'To ensure we are leading the way with pricing we offer our boats for hiring without the requirement to include a skipper. Other companies hire out boats with a skipper as standard and this can inflate hiring prices considerably, whereas we believe the customer should be able to choose everything, from the boat and how it is kitted out, to length of hire and skipper requirements especially as many of our customers have fully qualified skippers in their teams already – offering a truly bespoke service.'\n\nWorkboat UK’s customer focus and expert knowledge would be useless if the boats and pontoons used were not up to the task required. This is why John teamed up with well-established Caley Marine. Their reputation for sourcing the best boats is second to none.\n\n'Caley Marine supplies us with the extremely robust, agile and configurable Pioner series crafts. The sheer number of options and versatility available is astounding. Made using rotation-moulded polyethylene, the Pioner boats are extremely rugged and durable.  They have a double skin design so even with severe deck flooding they remain buoyant and will self-drain.'\n\n'From the Pioner Multi Mk3 which we can provide fully MCA coded to work ‘At Sea’ with its enormous carrying capacity, superb sea keeping abilities and unique front opening bow door, to the Steady series with impressive stability characteristics increasing safety and making them ideal for those who are new to boat handling or experienced crew aware of their need for a robust workhorse which can be carried to remote inland locations, we can supply a boat for any need.'  \n\nAlthough Workboat UK has only been operating a short time their reputation for offering an honest professional service has seen some impressive clientele such as the BBC and the Environment Agency.\n\n'I’m pleasantly surprised with the types of use our services are seeing. Whilst we offer our services to anyone, offering full briefing of equipment and controls, we originally thought marine industries supporting survey, inspection and construction would be our main focus. While yes we generate a huge repeat business from companies within this sector, we’re seeing a massive use of our services within film industries and leisure sectors which keeps life interesting.'\n\nEnsuring the longevity of his company, John’s always listening to the feedback received from clients, and through understanding customers’ needs he’s able to ensure Workboat UK are ahead of the competition offering the best services and equipment available.\n\n'Because we offer truly bespoke hiring services it’s important we take feedback on board. Repeat custom is only possible through being as passionate as the client and offering them what they need, when they need it. We offer our services for any use and our hiring criteria’s minimal. We just ask for a Powerboat level 2 accreditation, and the client to provide their own insurance.'\n\nTo view the extensive range of models in work boats and pontoons available at Workboat UK visit the website below. Alternatively contact John directly to discuss your marine requirements and he’ll professionally assess your needs, offering advice on the best boat for your specific application.\n\nTelephone: 07802 308 384\nEmail: john@workboatuk.com\nWebsite: www.workboatuk.com\n",

          "DetailDescription": "Black Storm Brewery, who are renowned winners of the prestigious World Beer Awards, are proud to brew a selection of craft ales from their head office in Whitley Bay, serving drinks from their renowned Storm Cellar, alongside supplying their beverages to a range of retail outlets. \n\nBlack Storm Brewery was founded by Paul Hughes, who turned his brewing dream into a reality when he established the company as part of his Entrepreneurship Master’s Degree. During his time at university, Paul was lucky enough to meet his two business partners at a networking event arranged by the university, realising his brewing vision and setting the wheels in motion for what would end up being a brilliantly, unique, world-class brewery. \n\nPaul’s initial aim was to create an authentically British brewing company that brought real, hand-crafted beer back to the North East, offering new and original ales to the taste buds of the North. However thanks to the success of the company in Tyne and Wear, news of the brewery’s mouth-watering ales spread throughout the UK, increasing demand to supply up and down Britain. The company now supply all over the UK, and even offer their delightful flavours to anyone willing to sample them. \n\nIt is important to note that customer’s looking for the original, authentic Black Storm experience are better off visiting the company’s Bottle Shop and Tasting Room, which is based in the picturesque, seaside town of Whitley Bay. At the Bottle Shop, guests can sample 10 lines of hand-crafted ale, alongside a selection of spirits, wines, ciders and beers. The bottle shop and tasting-rooms boast a warm and welcoming atmosphere that is also lively, proving to be the ideal spot for anyone wanting to discover new beers and flavours. It is also perfect for any guests looking to take the opportunity to play a selection of board games whilst socialising with both brewers and visitors alike. \n\nIt is clear to see that enjoyment and exceptional customer service is at the heart of the brewery, welcoming anyone and everyone to come and try their tasty range of alcoholic beverages. This is evident in the company’s commitment to respond to increasing customer demand, bringing out a range of hand-crafted gins, infused with sensational tastes. Their initial gin, Bottled Storm, is made with 13 botanicals that will excite taste buds and fill the mouth with one-of-the-kind, palatable flavour.  \n\nWe recently interviewed Black Storm’s Managing Director, Paul Hughes, who told us about the benefits Black Storm offer that their competitors do not. “Our beers are all British, the malts come from Berwick and the hops come from Kent, whilst our gin is small batch handcrafted with 13 botanicals. However, our biggest difference is in our provision of exceptional guest experience and second-to-none customer experience in our retail outlets. This is because we place customer satisfaction at the forefront of all business decisions, as we believe that the customer is the key to all business success.”\n\nWe also asked Paul if the company are looking to make any changes to the company. “We have recently purchased one of our competitors and are opening a third venue to sell our produce. We also have plans to expand our range of products so that we include our own vodka range. We hope this range will be available around Christmas, before we plan to purchase another brewery in 2019.”\n\nPaul also told us about the company’s recent success at several trade shows, including the Specialty Fine Food Fare, The Restaurant Show and Scotland’s National Convenience Show. The company were also pleased to attend the BBC Good Food Show where their ales were applauded by visitors and industry peers. Visitors were noticeably impressed by the beverages’ unique flavour, which was heralded as being the Best of British in ale manufacturing. The brewery’s IPA got special commendation for its soft bitterness and floral, citrus flavour, offering an unmatched aroma through its use of cascade hops. \n\nIndustry peers were happy to recommend the company’s Bitter too, which combines caramel and summer fruit flavours, making it ideal for a hot day relaxing under the summer sun. Alongside the bitter, the company’s refreshing Summer Storm offers customers a tantalising blonde with a small kick, “taking you back to the summer holidays when you didn’t have to worry about schools or bills or a boss”.\n\nKnowledge of the company’s advancement into the gin market also garnered a lot of interest from attendees, praising the revival of traditional British distilled gin and welcoming samples from Black Storm. \n\nIf you would like to get in touch with Black Storm Brewery, contact them on the number listed below.

          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is pleased to present Moo Free Chocolates as our Dairy-Free Chocolate Company of the Month. The company are proud to craft delicious mouth-watering chocolates that are made with cocoa and rice milk, instead of cow’s milk, giving the chocolate a wonderfully extra creamy taste. All of their produced chocolate is vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free and free from soya, therefore meaning Moo Free Chocolates cater to a variety of different dietary requirements. \n\nThe company was established in 2010 by Mike and Andrea Jessop, a husband and wife duo who set up their business after experimenting with dairy-free recipes in their family kitchen. This came about due to Andrea’s son’s dietary requirements, as he could not consume any dairy products, and therefore could not enjoy the lovely taste of chocolate, a hardship for any child at Easter or Christmas. \n\nIn a recent interview with Moo Free Chocolates’ Marketing Executive, Christopher Pritchard, we asked what benefits their products bring to clients that their competitors do not.\n\n“Our products are completely free from traces of dairy (and derivatives thereof), gluten and soya as we have none of these present in either of our factories. The lack of soya is particularly notable as many other dairy-free chocolate manufacturers will use soya in their chocolates. There is, however, a high incidence rate between dairy allergies and soya allergies and so we have eliminated soya from our products. The ingredients used by Moo Free Chocolates are also ethically sourced from organic plantations and the company sends zero waste to landfill, recycling everything that can be recycled and sending that waste that cannot be recycled to be used to generate energy for other local businesses.”\n\nChristopher also told us that the company are looking to expand their range of couvertures, which give clients the option to develop ‘free from’ chocolate in their own homes, useful in the creation of sweets and delicious cake toppers. Christopher also informed us that over the next few years, the company are looking to expand their presence in both the UK and abroad.\n\n“We'd love to take our chocolate into the mainstream market to let everyone experience our premium, ethical chocolate.”\n\nIt is also important to note that Moo Free Chocolates has garnered a variety of praise from various trade shows around the globe. Earlier this year the company attended Germany’s ISM 2018, where their chocolates were heralded by attendees and industry peers who applauded the company’s commitment to ethical sourcing, whilst attendees were overwhelmed by the chocolate’s flavoursome taste and world-class diary free ingredients which, if anything, added to the deliciousness of the chocolate. \n\nIf you would like to get in touch with Moo Free Chocolates, contact them on the number listed below.

          "CompanyName": "Anthea Harding’s Educational Therapy ",
          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is incredibly pleased to present their richly deserved Therapy & Wellbeing Services Company of the Year Award to Anthea Harding’s Educational Therapy due to her dedication and determination to help children with their personal and social development.\n\nSet up in 2002 as a private practice, Anthea’s exceptional work focuses on the early development of children which includes the all-important Emotional Literacy. After proving to be extremely successful in helping clients overcome certain challenges and continue to grow and succeed through life, Anthea decided to expand her exceptional services and aims to integrate these into schools and nurseries as part of the everyday classroom experience.\n\n“It wasn’t until 2016 that I took my work and product (Emotional Literacy Floor Sheet) into the public arena through education shows and conferences,” commented Anthea. “However, over the year I came to realise that shows and conferences aren’t the ideal vehicle for getting my message across to people.\n\n“Education shows are extremely busy places with so much to see and information to gather that people are unable to linger for too long. Similarly at conferences the time available to delegates to engage with those exhibiting is limited. Throughout the year the response to my work was positive and people could see the benefits but I have learnt that there are two areas which need attention. \n\n“Firstly, people need an in depth background about the benefits of emotional literacy, more than can be explained in a five minute chat. Secondly, school managers need to be convinced that introducing emotional literacy doesn’t have to be a whole school initiative. Some people find talking about emotions very difficult so introducing a whole school initiative could be doomed to fail. But, introducing emotional literacy by stealth is a much more workable possibility! \n\n“By that I mean introducing emotional literacy to one interested adult and two children and two weeks later repeating the process with another adult and two more pupils. As children are naturally curious it doesn’t take long for word to spread about the benefits of using the floor sheet and in time adults may find it a beneficial way to ‘unpick’ their day before they head home. Therefore, my new project is to write a book about the benefits of emotional literacy and how to use it and I’m pleased to say that the book is currently in process.”\n\nAnthea’s unique technique consists of allowing children to really get to grips with and understand what they are feeling, thinking and doing which is the process of emotional literacy. During sessions children and young adults learn this process by walking on a floor sheet which Anthea has developed and she refers to this as giving children a ‘tool-kit’ for facing life’s challenges. By working closely with clients, Anthea is able to identify incomplete stages in development or those which consist of gaps, and establishes a plan which revisits these stages and allows children to become emotionally literate.\n\n“Throughout the early stages of life, people go through a series of developmental steps,” Anthea explained. “Each stage must be completed as fully as possible before moving on to the next. Sometimes, children struggle with a certain stage which may be due to a challenge they have faced, problems at home or late development, leading to issues continuing to the next stages in life. \n\n“What do I do when I don’t know what to do?’ is the expression I base my techniques around. This is commonly the dilemma we experience when we aren’t emotionally literate. The floor sheet technique gives children the confidence to discover and express their feelings which helps them in building self-esteem and provides them with a sense of independence.\n\n“Children often play up or cause trouble when they are faced with certain situations because they do not understand what they are feeling. During my sessions I look at exactly what is driving their behaviour and find ways to help them regulate it in the future. People are all different, and they go through the developmental stages at different paces, so the trick is to be patient and not force a child to rush. I also work with parents and guardians so that they are equipped to support their children in any situation.”\n\nAnthea’s work has been greatly appreciated by many clients, who have seen major differences in child development and emotional literacy. She hopes to continue her work with schools and organisations to help improve emotional development at an early stage to avoid problems in later life. She is also looking to set up Skype sessions with clients for easy access and is working on recording a ‘mock up’ of one of her sessions to allow people to see exactly how they work. \n\n“It was never my expectation that my business would expand rapidly overnight, so for me slow but steady is excellent,” Anthea continued. “The people I work with, whether children or adults, need time to make changes in their lives and providing that along with the space they need is what ensures positive outcomes. In terms of my business I always keep the tortoise and hare in mind!\n\n“My focus in 2016 was to bring emotional literacy to the attention of schools. However, the information that has been in the public domain connected to that project has caught the attention of parents who have children who were born prematurely. I am delighted to say that that side of my business is slowly growing.\n\n“At present I work alone and have no plans to change that situation for the foreseeable future so how do I measure success? It is seeing the client grow in confidence and take control of their own life. As I work with people I pay attention to my own growth and development as I know that each time I work with someone I too am learning. It is a two way street.”\n\n“Working in educational therapy has been a huge learning curve,” she concluded. “I have worked with so many children and am pleased to say there has been a great deal of success stories. There is nothing better than to see a child using the process of emotional literacy to live a happy and healthy lifestyle. Being emotionally literate and building solid foundations for life in the early years gives children the best opportunity for good mental health. \n\n“Being selected for The Company of the Year Award is beyond my wildest dreams.  I feel very honoured that I have been ‘chosen’ and the award has made me stop and really think about everything I achieved last year. I feel proud. There is also a firm, solid affirmation in the award that gives me a sense that while my business isn’t huge it is very real and has been seen and I would like to thank everyone involved for that.”\n\nM 07771 698075\nmail@antheaharding.co.uk\nwww.antheaharding.co.uk",

The franchise model combines expert training, mentoring and support with all of the resources required to establish a profitable and enjoyable retail venture.\n\nFounder and Chairman Steve Bolton was keen to tell us more about the structure of this all-encompassing solution. “We operate by means of a long term franchise partnership because we believe that commitment on both sides is important,” he commented. “Because of this, it is fundamental that the customer fits the brief: they must have a minimum of £30,000 of investment funds, be confident using technology and have the motivation to create a successful online retail business. Establishing a connection early on is also a necessity for us because in order to build and grow a business as a team we must have first developed a bond based on mutual trust and respect.”\n\nThe franchise opportunity is open to customers across a wide variety of sectors and skill-sets; PBP has worked with people operating at a managerial level as well as accountants and those with retail and marketing backgrounds. Some customers are continuing to work full time or are bringing up a young family alongside building their ecommerce business. Generally speaking, clients can be divided into two main categories: corporate individuals who want to start working for themselves by starting up their own business and entrepreneurial people who might have other business but want to begin another project. \n\nInterestingly, PBP is the second Platinum franchise; the first, Platinum Property Partners, has been running for 10 years and the success of its tried and tested model prompted franchise partners to ask for another opportunity that would appease individuals working to a more restricted budget. Its mission, however, has remained the same: to enlighten aspiring business owners about the growing potential of the online retail marketplace whilst using the strength of a long term working relationship to bring clients a sizable return on their investment.\n\n“As we are a relatively new company our main priority has been on building up a successful franchise whilst adapting as appropriate in response to the changes in the ecommerce space,” Steve concluded. “We’ve already welcomed over 100 partners since April 2016 and our plan going forward is to continue growing the business, taking it to the highest level. We want our partners to do well because if they succeed, then we succeed. We are looking to recruit 10 new partners every month and are hoping to attract further interest from potential partners by attending the majority of trade shows within the franchise and start-up business arena.”\n\nIf you have ambition but would benefit from becoming part of a supportive and productive community revolved around a proven training programme, then get in touch with PBP today.",

A rich background in (and knowledge of) card systems and biometrics has enabled the team to establish themselves as competent performers in the design and development of fully integrated and specified solutions.\n\nThe main aim of idXtra is to assist customers – namely schools, academies, colleges, local authorities and corporations – in an operational way with the supply of quality innovations incorporating multiple features. Its range of proven smart card systems, access control products, electronic registration and cashless catering systems have been widely recognised for their ability to enhance student performance, simplify administration, augment safeguarding, and save valuable staff time.\n\nSales Director, Tony Walsh, was keen to tell us more about how the company has been progressing in recent times. “The last year has been quite exciting for us,” he confided. “We have kept innovating and launching new products so I feel that we have done very well. We pushed our EPOS (cashless catering) product EventPOS really hard and we won some very good contracts. We also secured a significant deal with a large university in the Midlands for attendance monitoring, which has helped us stay on track with our probe into the higher education sector.\n\nThe company is currently at various stages of marketing and releasing additional solutions which have been strategically designed to further enhance its existing offering. The first relevant product to note is a handheld tablet EPOS, which is essentially a full specification touch screen that can, in effect, eliminate the build-up of heavy queues in schools and colleges. Because of its structure the device can be held in one hand and navigated with the other, making it most suitable for busy environments requiring a speedy and efficient service.\n\nOther important developments involve a wall-mounted kiosk that can be used for loading cash onto catering and PaperCut (print & photocopy) purses and a new Visitor Management app named VisiTapp, which acts as a safe and secure swipe/tap IN and OUT system for regulars and effective access monitoring system logging visitor, contractor and guest admission. All of these products will be showcased by the team at BETT next January, where they will be exhibiting at London’s ExCeL on stand A230.\n\n“I am very encouraged by my team’s performance in both busy and quiet times,” Tony concluded. “Our plan is to strongly market our products to both existing and new customers. We are investing in a marketing colleague to deal with all product promotions, brochures, website design and social media which in the short term will help us to attract additional clients. In the long term we want to grow to the next level and become a well-known brand recognised for innovation and reliability.\n\n“Overall it feels great to have been selected for this award and to have worked with the Business and Industry Today team, who have great knowledge of the various market segments in the UK. It has therefore been an honour to win acknowledgement as a Company of the Year for 2016, and I know that the whole team are really proud of this achievement.”",

          "DetailDescription": "With an ageing population and increasing demand on nurses and healthcare staff, it’s no secret the healthcare sector is one of the fastest growing industries in the UK – and worldwide. Therefore it’s an exciting industry to consider when starting your own business. However, as so many of those who have tried and failed have found out, compliance and legislation can make it difficult to get your foot in the door.\n\nThankfully, Kare Plus is here to change all that.\n\nWith over 25 years in the healthcare sector, the Kare Plus model has been designed by directors and ex-Kare Plus franchise owners, Steve and Tom, to fully support those wishing to enter the booming industry.\n\nCompliance within the sector is extremely important and, at times, difficult to manage – with changes and improvements in legislation occurring frequently. Kare Plus was founded on the basis of strong compliance and thus has compliance procedures at its core – going above and beyond many industry standards. Not only does this provide your Kare Plus franchise with a strong reputation from day one, it also allows you to focus more time on recruitment and service development.\n\nA Kare Plus franchise offers much more than compliance security though. With a fully trained support team, consisting of marketing, finance, HR, research and development, business development and recruitment, you always have the support of experts ready to assist you and your business.\n\nPerhaps most importantly though, purchasing an established franchise such as Kare Plus gives you a brand identity that people recognise and trust, as Kare Plus’ Franchise Sales Manager, Vikki Donnachie, explains, “People are attracted to brands they know; they have confidence in the name. By purchasing a Kare Plus franchise, you are buying into a business with a brand that’s already been developed, marketed and, most importantly, a brand that people are familiar with. Having a strong name attached to your service offering will help you get your business off the ground.”\n\nAs the UK’s most established multi-service healthcare franchise, Kare Plus franchise owners are able to provide an award-winning healthcare service range that goes above and beyond traditional home care. All franchise owners have the opportunity to provide specialist and non-specialist nursing, supported living services, critical care services, medical and non-medical home care and more. Not only does this allow franchise owners to bolt on new regulated services which they may struggle with on their own, but also means they have access to multiple income streams.\n\nWith such a variety of healthcare services, Kare Plus presents an opportunity with true social value also, as explained by Director of Operations, Dominic Rothwell, “A Kare Plus franchise represents an opportunity to build sustainable business with a high degree of social value. If you are looking for an opportunity that combines a sound commercial proposition with a high degree of personal satisfaction then we would welcome your call.”\n\nKare Plus currently has 70 branches across the UK and has opportunities for new franchise owners to join the ever-growing network. If you would like to find out more about setting up your own Kare Plus franchise in the New Year, or would like to find out more about what the healthcare sector could hold for you, contact the Kare Plus franchise sales team on: franchising@kareplus.co.uk or call 01952 783338.",

          "DetailDescription": "Whilst customers will often think to protect their skin in the colder months, many forget that the winter season can also cause Dry Eye symptoms such as redness, a ‘gritty’ feeling or excessively watery eyes.\n\nResearch from Scope Group reveals that people suffering from Dry Eye disease symptoms are most likely to visit a pharmacy for a solution first, and that being ‘HCP recommended’ is the most important factor when it comes to selecting a product.\n\nScope Group Pharmacist, John Freyne, explains, “While dry eye is a year-round condition, it often becomes more prevalent, and symptoms more severe, in winter. Assessing the severity of symptoms using a questionnaire like the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) - a 12 item scale for the assessment of symptoms relating to dry eye disease and their effect on vision - with the patient is key to providing effective relief from the ongoing discomfort associated with seasonal Dry Eye.”\n\nThe Hycosan range caters to all severities of Dry Eye disease thanks to the Sodium Hyaluronate formulations. The eye drops are fully contact lens compatible and sterile for 6 months from opening due to the unique bottle design. The use of a preservative-free eye drop from the Hycosan range, can be supplemented with a lid hygiene product such as OcuSoft to promote ongoing eye care.",

Some companies will already have this cover either as a\nseparate policy or as part of their commercial combined policies.We can also quote competitive rates for this type of insurance. An\nattractive alternative that IFL offers is cover on the basis of an\nindividual declaration per shipment, which means that the cargo owner can\npick and choose the shipments for which cover is needed.Who arranges insurance cover?\nWe are frequently asked who is responsible for arranging the insurance\ncover so here are the main Incoterms in current use, which answer this\nquestion:\n• EXW (Ex Works) – the buyer\n• FCA (Free Carrier) – the buyer\n• FOB (Free On Board) – the buyer\n• CIP (Carriage and Insurance Paid) – the seller\n• CPT (Carriage Paid To) – the seller up to the named destination; the\nbuyer thereafter\n• DAP (Delivered At Place) – the seller\n• DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) – the sellerHow to claim\nFinally, here are some general points to bear in mind relating to insurance\nclaim procedures.Clean PODs – under RHA and BIFA conditions, a clean proof of delivery\ndocument signifies the end of the legal contract of carriage between the\ncustomer and the forwarder or carrier – and insurers will not normally pay\nany claim if there is a clean POD.Retain damaged goods for inspection – insurers may wish to establish if any\nsalvage value can reduce their liability.Photographs – this type of evidence is now a key factor in the speedy\nsettlement of claims for damage.VAT – insurers do not settle any UK value added tax relating to insurance\nclaims; these amounts must be reclaimed through normal accounting\nprocedures.Cost-price basis – insurers settle claims on a cost-price basis and will\nrequire documentary evidence to verify this.Goods in transit insurance advice and quotes\nFor general advice and guidance relating to goods in transit insurance\nclaims, or to get a quote, please call +44 (0)1675 434690 or email us\nat: enquiries@internationalforwarding.co.uk\n",

Storing, charging and managing large groups of these devices can be tricky; there are a lot of cables and chargers to organise. We know that many customers also need the ability to relocate the storage from room to room with the security and safety of a fixed point solution.\n\nLoxit’s range of iBank products are packed full of features that are specially designed for the management of multiple tablets and iPads. The unique Loxit design combines weight saving technology with years of engineering expertise to create:\n - A steel construction that is durable, lightweight and secure\n - Easy access to the tablets, increasing usability and making the solution suitable for all\n - Flexible storage with each compartment measuring up to 270mm wide x 300mm high x 30mm thick\n - A slimline design with small footprint for maximum efficiency\n\nA recent project with Carnival UK saw a need for small, compact charging and storing of a particular combination of devices. Our in-house design team worked with client to adapt our standard iBank unit to accommodate exactly what they needed.\n\nDave Desmond, musical director, Carnival UK, explains, 'The Loxit units have proved ideal for the roll out of iPads used in a bespoke digital sheet music reading system for Carnival UK, across the P&O Cruises and Cunard fleet. Working with the requirements of Session Corner, who designed and implemented the roll out, Loxit designed a mobile trolley to specifically house our combination of 9.7 inch and 12.9 inch iPads. They combined this with a 10 unit charger that supplies full and accurate charge to each device. The iBank units have a welcome degree of adaptability, are well constructed and not over packaged. Both Carnival UK and Session Corner have experienced excellent and prompt communication with Loxit from initial contact to delivery.'\n\nOptions\nAs a UK manufacturer we are perfectly placed to create and deliver bespoke solutions for our clients. Our product range is constantly evolving, this year we have introduced the Lapbank TL. Taking many elements of the successful tablet storage formula and adding increased utility, Top Loading, making the daily use of the trolley even easier.\n\nReviews\n\nDean Jones, Hagley Catholic High School\nA very good product, the Lapbank TL trolley is suitably robust, yet easy and light enough to manoeuvre. The top loading is great, the cable management works well. The customer support was excellent too.\n\nPhil Youles, Tesco Technical Training Group\nThe cart’s ease of use – the tablets are simple to install and remove. The security is great – the offices are widely accessible to staff and others, but the tablets have remained safe and secure at all times.\n\nJohn Entwistle, Bolton Schools ICT\nWe have looked at many store and charge cart solutions and all too often been let down by the build quality and durability. So when we came across Loxit we were delighted to find not only a good range of excellently designed trolleys, but also very robust construction in a rugged yet compact solution. Being a UK company with UK production was also reassuring, as we needed to be able to guarantee the quality and delivery schedules to fit in with the schools’ timetables.\n\nSeveral years on, our initial assessments have proved correct, the Loxit carts have stood the test of time very well. Proving to be as durable as they appeared and we continue to be impressed by the professionalism and dedication of the Loxit team.\n\nThe Loxit experience\nFor over 2 decades we have collaborated with our customers and technology partners to perfect solutions for everything from iPads and laptops to touch screens and AV furniture.\n\nToday Loxit is recognised around the world as a leading light in the delivery of innovative solutions for the storage, security, charging and data transfer for mobile devices.\n\nA reputation based on quality products, made to our exacting standards, and high levels of service.

          "DetailDescription": "Union Industries, the Leeds-based, employee-owned manufacturer, is on track for its most successful year since it was established in 1975, with its half-year report revealing it is set to turnover in excess of £7m in the 16/17 financial year. This smashes last year’s performance which itself a record breaking year for the company.\n\nThis represents an increase of just over 30% compared to the previous year, building on its position as a British manufacturer of high quality Rapid Roll Industrial Doors, along with a focus on expanding its presence in the high-growth Industrial Curtain market.\n\nPre-tax profits are up by a shade over 133% compared to the same period in 2015 and it continues to experience growth in demand for its high-quality products, which are used in a number of sectors including food manufacturing, logistics, defence and pharmaceutical.\n\nTwo years ago, Union Industries made the transition into becoming an employee-owned company after its founders, Paul and Isobel Schofield, sold their majority shares to the Union Industries Employee Ownership Trust.\n\nUnder its Employee Ownership scheme, every member of staff at Union Industries was awarded an equal share of the business; new starters who join are also given shares after 12 months of employment.\n\nThe manufacturer built upon its financial success by recently securing the Innovation of the Year Award at the annual UK Employee Ownership Awards for making its fast acting freezer Eiger Door into an ‘intelligent’ door by using a device to reduce energy and so reduce running costs, which is very important for Union’s ‘blue-chip’ customers. This innovative idea was drawn from Union’s ‘Eureka Bath’, which encourages staff to submit suggestions to improve the business and products. And so the ‘Intelligent Eiger Door’ was launched earlier this year.\n\nThe EOA awards, which celebrate and recognise excellence in employee owned businesses across the UK, were held at the Hilton Hotel near Birmingham’s NEC on 21st November, and played host to over 600 delegates.\n\nFrom its factory based in West Yorkshire, Union manufactures a range of industrial products, including their market-leading range of High Speed Industrial Doors that they proudly claim are the most reliable doors in the world. These fast acting doors are installed in distribution centres, warehouses, factories and storage facilities to improve logistics and help maintain environmental conditions for discerning companies across the UK and Europe.\n\nAlan Hirst, Sales Director at Union Industries, said, “Our impressive performance in the first six months of this financial year is indicative of the effectiveness of our Employee Ownership model, which has empowered staff at every level and added to the family-like culture we’ve always encouraged in the business.\n\n“Since day one the company has placed an emphasis on using high-quality components to manufacture products that are built to last and so highlight the false economy that exists with budget doors that are unreliable and incur expensive maintenance costs. As the great Sir Henry Royce once said, ‘The quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten’.\n\n“We’re very proud of the progress we’ve made in the past 24 months since becoming an EO company and to be recognised by the Employee Ownership Association was an honour, and will certainly spur us on to our next innovation.”",

          "DetailDescription": "Humidity levels drop in the winter because cold air holds less moisture\nthan warm air. Many large buildings, warehouses and factories use air\nhandling units to ventilate and heat large areas.These units take the cold dry air from outside and convert it to warm air\ninside. The problem gets worse when the dry air heats as it loses even more\nmoisture, resulting in lower relative humidity.The Science\nRelative humidity is the amount of water vapour actually in the air,\nexpressed as a percentage of the maximum amount of water vapour the air can\nhold at the same temperature.At any given moment an air molecule will hold a certain amount of moisture\n– more on rainy days than hot sunny days. In winter, cold outside air\n(whether ‘wet’ or ‘dry’) is brought inside and heated. As air heats it\nexpands, but the actual moisture content of each molecule cannot change,\nand therefore the relative humidity falls.It is widely acknowledged that maintaining relative humidity levels between\n40-60% significantly improves human well-being and mechanical performance.\nRead more to find out how low humidity effects both human and mechanical\nproduction.How does low humidity effect our wellbeing?\nLow indoor relative humidity has a negative effect on human comfort. The\nadult human body is typically 60% water, so in a dry environment our bodies\nnaturally lose moisture. Unlike temperature, low humidity is more difficult\nto detect.Typical symptoms include:\nDry and itchy skin\nCracked lips\nDry eyes (especially for those with contact lens)\nSore throats\nNosebleeds\nHeadachesIn addition, low relative humidity dries our mucous membranes and inhibits\nour body’s natural defence against germs, viruses, and bacteria, making us\nmuch more vulnerable to catching common colds and flus. Maintaining\nrelative humidity between 40-60% is scientifically proven to reduce the\nspread of airborne pollutants and viruses.How does low humidity effect mechanical processes?\nMoisture absorption also affects hygroscopic materials like wood and paper.\nThe low humidity dries out these materials causing them to shrink, curl,\ncrack or split. When these materials pass through machines, usually at high\nspeeds, it causes paper jams and machine breakdowns. A list of common\nproblems is listed below:\nStatic electricity build-up and ESD\nDrying out of hygroscopic materials like wood and paper\nPaper jams and machine breakdowns\nIncreased wastage\nDecreased productivityThe Solution\nThere is a wide range of humidifiers and a variety of factors to consider\nin selecting the right humidifier for each building or application, such as\nenergy use, water supply, cold water or steam, gas or electric, evaporative\nor spray, humidifier situation, control compatibility & maintenance needs.It is therefore important to seek advice from specialists who can provide\nguidance and design a bespoke system that will serve each unique\nspecification. Installation, commissioning, spare parts, ongoing service\nand maintenance costs also need to be considered, and a planned maintenance\ncontract is recommended to ensure equipment is kept in good working order\nand the initial investment is not wasted.Humidity Solutions have a team of experienced and highly knowledgeable\nengineers who can advise on a full range of applications and provide a\ncomplete turnkey solution, providing reassurance for the customer and\nprotecting their investment in both their people and their machinery.T 01372 571200\ninfo@humiditysolutions.co.uk\nwww.humiditysolutions.co.uk\n",

          "DetailDescription": "Secondary glazing manufactured and installed by Granada Glazing was\nspecified to provide modern levels of comfort for guests at a new Premier\nInn built on a Grade II listed former hotel site in Llandudno town centre.The £12m redevelopment of the former Tudno Castle Hotel site comprises a 90-\nbedroom hotel, one restaurant and three retail/restaurant units and a\ngym/business unit. It opened in Spring 2022 following a protracted planning\nprocess and delays.The Tudno Castle is a Grade II listed building built in the 1870s. It had\nbeen derelict since 2008 and six years later, planning permission was\ngranted for the demolition of the building behind a retained façade and the\nerection of a new hotel and extension.Work started in 2017 but had to be put on hold when partial demolition work\nof the structure revealed that the Grade II listed façade of the building\nwas unstable. This meant that the developers Tudno Developments Ltd had to\ncome up with revised plans which would allow the demolition of the\nVictorian façade followed by its reconstruction on a like-for-like basis.Faithfully recreating the historic façade meant installing timber single-\nglazed sash windows which were treated with Granada Glazing’s latest high-\nspecification secondary glazing range to reduce outside noise intrusion and\nimprove the thermal efficiency.A total of 46 units were installed – a combination of traditional-looking\nBalanced Vertical Sliders and Hinged Units – all with 6.4mm laminate Low E\nglass that reflects heat back into the rooms. Both products deliver 21st\ncentury standards of thermal and acoustic efficiency for single glazed\nprimary original, or in this case, replica windows.“Where double glazing cannot be installed due to planning regulations,\nsecondary glazing is often the preferred solution. It offers a cost-\neffective and efficient solution in reducing external noise by up to 80%\nand improving thermal insulation by up to 65%,” says Robert Cottam, Granada\nGlazing Commercial Sales Manager.“In establishments such as hotels, creating a warmer and quieter\nenvironment is essential for guests’ comfort and this is where secondary\nglazing scores very highly.”Premier Inn’s initial plan was for a 63-bedroom hotel but after considering\nthe best format for its guests, decided to add a further 27 bedrooms by\noccupying the vacant retail space in the development. Construction\ncontractor Medlock FRB Ltd was appointed to add the new rooms and their\nsite manager Martin Blundell has noticed the difference that secondary\nglazing has made.“It has definitely made the rooms a lot quieter, and you can’t hear the\ntraffic outside,” he observes. “The system looks very neat, and the Granada\nteam did a really good installation job. The transoms on the window match\nthe transoms of the secondary glazing so it doesn’t interrupt the look at\nall.”Suitable for all property types, Granada’s slimline aluminium secondary\nglazing frames can be powder coated in over 200 RAL colours. Virtually\ninvisible, they blend in with any interior décor. The Granada Glazing\nproduct range encompasses hinged, sliding, vertical sliders, including tilt\nback, and lift-out options.For more information on the Granada Secondary Glazing range, please call\n01909 499899 or visit: www.gsecg.com or email: info@granadaglazing.com\n",

          "DetailDescription": "Our sister publication Industrial Process News was recently pleased to present Hilsonic with its highly sought after Cleaning Equipment Specialist Company of the Year Award. \n\nDating back to 1976, Hilsonic are leading British designers and manufacturers of advanced ultrasonic cleaners and cleaning equipment. The established company was set up by Henry Kevin Ratcliffe and was taken over by his son John Caza three years after. In 2006, Managing Director, Darren Pyke, along with two other long term employees were given the unique opportunity to become shareholders and directors. \n\nOver the years, it has gone from strength to strength, growing year on year and becoming renowned for their exceptional equipment and outstanding customer service. \n\n“The last 12 months has been both challenging and rewarding,” commented Darren. “We have been awarded contracts from industry leading companies and are working on some exciting new developments with our partners. In the last 3 years we have seen continued growth in the region of 10-20% and our aim is to build on this growth for our future by supplying more high quality equipment manufactured here in the UK.”\n\nWith over 35 years’ experience, Hilsonic supplies a broad range of industries across both the UK and Europe with a full range of powerful equipment which incorporates specialist technology to remove dirt, grime and contamination from different products and apparatus. \n\nTheir solutions are based on an ultrasonic cleaning process utilising piezo electric transducers attached to individual tanks. The patented technology involved uses ultrasound to remove stains and germs from all types of hard surfaces (including metals, plastics and ceramics), penetrating cavities that are otherwise untouchable. The removal of grime takes place within seconds, as the ultrasound waves generated vibrate the cleaning fluid at high velocity and temperature to produce millions of tiny bubbles that reach fissures present in items of all shapes, sizes and technical complexity.\n\nTheir advanced product portfolio comprises bench top tanks, industrial tanks, intercooler tanks, multi-stage tanks, submersible transducers, custom-built tanks, vapour de-greasing units, window blind cleaners and cleaning solutions suitable for dozens of sectors. Predominantly servicing the industrial, medical and commercial markets, typical applications include the rigorous cleansing of heat exchangers, window blinds, golf clubs, jewellery, intercoolers, microchips, surgical instruments, aircraft components, dentists’ drills, ceramics and engine parts.\n\nThe heavy duty systems for the power generation and shipping industries have always been extremely popular. A full range of units is available from small workshop cleaners to large intercooler cleaners with dimensions of 3m x 2m x 2m. In addition, the standard industrial and benchtop units are also a very popular choice.\n\nThis long-lasting and innovative equipment is available in both standard and customised options in line with customer requirements. Tanks that are made to order are manufactured specifically to meet the pre-established specifications outlined by the client to ensure the best possible results are reached, and it is this flexibility that has secured Hilsonic as the engineer’s prime choice for high performance ultrasonic cleaning products.\n\n“We produce ultrasonic cleaning equipment for any application whereby a manufacturing process takes place, as there is usually a necessity for cleaning there,” Darren explained. “Our customers range from engineering companies right through to those in the aerospace, pharmaceutical and medical markets, and our products are popular because of their convenience and efficiency as they enable clients to concentrate on other duties whilst the cleaning is completed. We stand out from our competitors because our longevity in the business ensures that we have the experience and the capacity to provide bespoke solutions.”\n\nWhen discussing how the company has kept up to date with changes in the industry whilst continuing to grow over the years, Darren told us, “Dealing in the modern economy is always going to be a challenge as situations seam to change on almost a daily basis. In general a high percentage of our sales are export and like any good UK brand it will always travel well, in fact we are also in the final 3 candidates for the Wirral Chamber of commerce Export trade award against some large international companies. \n“One of the benefits of the modern market is that with the internet your exposure on an international scale is far greater than it's ever been for the average small business and if you can maximise on this it helps spread the load and gives you more options in times of economic crisis.”\n\n“In terms of the future,” he concluded, “our plans are to strengthen our position in the international market as well as expand overseas with permanent agents and distributors who understand our product and can provide the same level of service to their local markets as we have here. We are also working on our ongoing program to implement and gain accreditation for a full quality system in line with latest ISO standards.\n\n“Being selected for the company of the year award is a great achievement for our company. Having someone outside the organisation recognising the hard work we are all putting in is very uplifting. Our success so far has been very much a team effort from production, finance and sales, all working together and supporting each other. We have an amazing team here and I'm always grateful for that.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about Hilsonic’s exceptional products and services then get in touch with the group today.",

          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is extremely proud to present Berry Plastics as its selected Cleaning Specialist of the Month and tell its readers more about its long standing and innovative Chicopee® brand.\n\nThe Chicopee brand has its roots dating back to the mid 1900's with its foundation by Johnson & Johnson. \n\nAs a strand under the Berry Plastics Health, Hygiene and Specialities (HH&S) division, Chicopee is a market-leading brand within the wipes segment. Providing a wide range of effective cleaning solutions for a variety of applications, the enterprise strives to improve employee and customer health with its pioneering technologies and problem-solving methods.\n\n“We are one of the only specialist wipes manufactures active in multiple segments,” commented James Taylor, Sales & Marketing Director EMEIA (Wipes). “This means we have a very wide portfolio to cater to all markets, working with leading players across several industries, and due to our size we are able to invest in market leading R&D which makes us one of the most innovative companies of our kind.\n\n“The company’s mission is to create a world of protection through the products and solutions that we can offer. Chicopee is focused on delivering on this message whether it is through our new patented Microfibre products that help reduce the risk of cross-contamination in healthcare environments or our patented Spinlace products, which are designed to improve the safety of employees within the manufacturing and industrial sector.”\n\nThe Spinlace technology is utilised in the production of DuraWipes. The most durable items in the range are considered a more convenient and consistent alternative to rags, whilst the lightest products make stronger and more cost-effective purchases than the more traditional papers and tissue wipers. The group is looking forward to extending its offering with two more qualities in late 2017, and is exploring the possibility of colour-coded wipes and new dispensing options to improve workflow and reduce wasted time.\n\nWith its main base in the Netherlands and 15 additional production sites in just Europe alone, Berry Plastics has an extensive support network that enables its team to effectively source unique materials and provide an international supply footprint for its strategic global partners. This enables the group to target customers within the foodservice, building care, industrial, healthcare, automotive and aerospace sectors.\n\nJames was keen to inform us about the team’s attendance at trade shows as well as its recent rebrand: “We attend around 10-15 exhibitions each year, ranging from foodservice shows like Sirha to the largest cleaning show in the world, ISSA Interclean,” he said. “These events are a key platform for us to reach new and existing customers to share our newest innovations and hold productive meetings. We also attend market specific shows such as Automechanika and Surfair, which are specialist automotive events.\n\n“We re-launched the brand in 2016 because we wanted to update our look and feel as well as our message. We re-named our product range using a much simpler structure, using product names that match the task – for example Polish Wipe, Soft Wipe etc. – and wanted to portray that Chicopee brings much more than just cleaning. It is also a tool that helps you complete your everyday but critical tasks, and in industry and manufacturing it is vital that this tool inspires confidence.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about Chicopee, then please contact Berry Plastics today",

Supported by facilities management company, Cloudfm, the quality and quantity of lighting displayed was assessed to look for alternatives in order to reduce energy usage and minimise the amount of maintenance needed.\n\nThe main focus of the initiative Cloudfm introduced was to change all the lights from typical T5 fluorescent tubes to intelligent digital LED luminaires. In total the team removed 2692 fittings and installed just 616 new LED lights into the warehouse.\n\nThis initial development was expected to produce a return of £8,000 in energy savings per month. While this was a positive start, Cloudfm investigated further and introduced a reactive element to the lights to reduce energy wastage further. This technology incorporates environment sensors, which utilise natural light to subsidise its own brightness levels. In total, Wolseley UK now saves £13,000 per month in energy costs.",

          "DetailDescription": "Responsible employers and business owners are rising to the challenge of\nproviding COVID-secure spaces, but most are still unsure of what is\nultimately required. There is a seemingly endless list of measures which\nmay be taken, some of which are touched on below, and key to designing your\nsolution is selecting and integrating those which will work best for you.\n\nMoreover, in this necessary exercise, Tara Moran from moteam.com reviews\nseveral defining aspects which can transform this challenge into valuable\nopportunity.\n\nFirstly, the impact on those who will be experiencing this adapted\nenvironment. Solution design must consider dignity as much as compliance.\nAn opportunity presents itself to foster a culture of safety, care and\ntrust, in keeping with the much talked of ‘reset’ and the obvious benefits\nof well-being as a powerful driver of morale, health and productivity.\n\nSecondly, the opportunity for cost savings in what at first appears to be\nsimply costs. The use of automation for tasks such as access checklists and\nvirtual inductions will provide cost savings in reduced labour, increased\nreliability and ease of record keeping.\n\nThirdly, with the documenting and controls needed to ensure safe spaces\ncomes new information streams, presenting opportunity for new and valuable\ninsights as evidenced in optimisation through i4.0 analytics in the\nmanufacturing sector.\n\nFinally, and on a cautionary note, as employers and business owners we are\nand will be, accountable for actions taken to ensure safety. This duty of\ncare is now more important than ever, and it may be a wise investment to\nprotect public and personnel now, to protect your business from accusation\nin the future. Space safe, conscience clear.\n\nTo create COVID-secure spaces and realise these opportunities a wide range\nof solutions can be deployed. These commonly include occupancy control,\ntemperature screening and contactless delivery of safety rules and hand\nsanitation before entering your venue.\n\nContactless kiosks at entrances can provide instant temperature screening\nwhile avoiding queues, allowing social distancing, and providing analytics\nfor insight and monitoring. In the incident of a failed temperature test,\ninstruction can be delivered on-screen, by phone message (SMS, WhatsApp,\nBluetooth) or vocally depending on appropriate discretion.\n\nThe system can be connected to LED lights on the entrance, programmed to\nshow red until system allows access via voice instruction and/or signalling\ngreen or connection to automatic doors or gates.\nDigital signage can display specific hygiene rules, thus delivering\ninformation while avoiding face-to-face contact. The device can be\nprogrammed to deliver inductions and pose questions which can be answered\nvocally to ensure information was understood.\n\nA contactless path into workplaces or venues can be continued with voice or\nsensor activated lifts. Maximum occupancy can be controlled by use of heat\nsensors inside the elevator and programming of number/pickup/set-down as\nappropriate.\n\nAccess control systems can extend to deliver occupancy control with\noccupancy determined by size of room and social distancing limitations\nwithin the room. This can be deployed with monitors at each room entrance\nand can also administer a one-way system, particularly important in venues\nthat are smaller in size.\n\nStarting times for employees can be staggered to minimise people arriving\nat one time, as well as shifts and breaks to minimise numbers in break\nrooms. Within workplaces, desks and workstations can be separated by clear\nscreens, allowing communication but reducing airborne contact. Mobile phone\napps can show location of available spaces within a building and for venues\nsuch as restaurants and bars can be used to place orders and process\npayments.\n\nMaterials like copper that are less hospitable to germs can be used, and\nreconfigured ventilation systems.\n\nFast-paced growth, brainstorming and increased collaboration happens in\nreal life, in real groups. Businesses need this to grow, and for the\neconomy to make a comeback. And for this, safe spaces are needed.

Traditional keyboards and mice can only be cleaned very simply and not sanitized. This is very critical as in healthcare applications keyboards are often used by a number of people at the same time or a station adjacent to a patient and therefore pose a threat of germ transference and proliferation.\n\n\n\nSanitizable keyboards and mice from the Active Key MedicalKey™ range are the best solution for working in controlled hygienic environments. Being completely sealed the devices are compatible with the most common cleaning and disinfection fluids. As a result, the keyboards can easily be implemented into any established cleaning processes and regimes.\n\n\n\nActive Key have worked extensively with UK leading NHS approved sanitize wipe suppliers and can provide COVID-19 clean surfaces for data input when such combinations are used. Whether at the dentist, at practitioners, in hospitals at ITU or in any other hygiene critical application, Active Key branded keyboards and mice help to avoid cross contamination on the keyboard at the workplace.

          "DetailDescription": "Established in 2011 by Clive Mason, an ex-police officer, Webeye offers\ninnovative solutions based around CCTV, intruder alarm and visual\nverification systems that are setting standards across the industry.\n\nWith a mission to improve safety and security across the globe, Clive\ninvented webeyeCMS, the only fully cloud-based alarm and monitoring\nplatform on the market. Over the years, he has built a specialist team\nwhich is dedicated to offering solutions to security professionals that\nimprove the effectiveness of security, guarding and alarm installation\nbusinesses. “Technology is the future of security,” said Trevor Lee,\nMarketing and Brand Manager. “We’re helping customers involved specifically\nin the guarding and construction industry to embrace this revolution.”\n\nWith a steadfast commitment to innovation, Webeye has recently launched\nv3.1 of webeyeCMS which now includes integration with the Calipsa False\nAlarm Reduction Platform. This gives customers instant access to Calipsa’s\nleading false alarm filtering solution, which uses the latest machine\nlearning technology to analyse whether the alarm contains human and/or\nvehicle movement. This then appears as a verified tick in the Webeye\nplatform. This integration of Calipsa gives Webeye customers a vital extra\nlayer of intelligence to help them make informed decisions, with cost\neffective and reliable machine learning to help drastically reduce time\nwasted dealing with false alarms.\n\n“I think this platform is one of our key differentiators,” explained\nTrevor. “It increases customer safety and can also check that their\nsecurity systems are working properly. We have patented systems in the\nplatform to ensure that alerts get sent through to all stakeholders quickly\n– a lot of work has been invested to ensure this, and the platform will\neven tell you who and when an alarm notification was answered so you have\nan effective audit trail.”\n\nWebeyeCMS is integrated with a range of different hardware, including\nbrands such as Videofied and Hikvision, as well as several of the company’s\nown products such as WebeyeFOG and WebeyeSOS.\n\nWebeyeFOG is one of Webeye’s most popular products at the moment, thanks to\nits ability to fill a large room with dense smoke within seconds, obscuring\nvisibility and forcing intruders to leave. It  is an ideal solution to help\nprotect shops, jewellers, banks and warehouses because it reacts quickly to\nprevent theft but does not leave any lasting residue or stains. With\nactivation via single or double confirmation, the WebeyeFOG is available in\nwired or wireless configurations, and is the only product on the market for\nthis price that effectively stops intruders in their tracks.\n\nAs well as the WebeyeFOG, the WebeyeSOS is an excellent personal protection\nsolution to help ensure the safety of guards and lone workers. Through the\nAndroid or iPhone app, the user can easily raise an alarm if they feel\nthreatened or vulnerable and the man down function raises an alarm if it\ndetects periods of inactivity. What’s more the optional ‘Track Me’ function\nacts as a great management tool because it allows workers to log in and out\nof daily tasks, meaning their location and duration can be monitored.\n\n“The company is growing very well,” concluded Trevor. “We’re gaining big\ntraction in South Africa, and we’ve got plans for further growth in\nAmerica. We’re always looking for other distribution partners around the\nglobe and we’re in conversation with security professionals to help improve\ntheir bottom line. It’s onwards and upwards!”\n\nIf you would like to find out more information on how Webeye can help you,\nhead to the website or get in touch using the contact details below.\n\nT 0115 714 9990\nsales@webeyecms.com\nwww.webeyecms.com\n",

          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is proud to announce that Brian Barr Solicitors has been selected as our Solicitors Company of the Month, for their steadfast commitment to supporting personal injury claimants with chronic pain or serious injuries.\n\nThe founder, Brian Barr, won a settlement of £1.25 million for a fibromyalgia sufferer in 1997. This sparked a particular interest for Brian in chronic pain cases, and in 2002 he established Brian Barr Solicitors as the first of its kind to cater specifically for Fibromyalgia and other chronic pain sufferers before branching out into other areas of complex personal injury litigation.\n\nBased in Greater Manchester, Brian Barr Solicitors’ key areas of expertise are Fibromyalgia, CRPS, clinical negligence, solicitor negligence and critical illness policy claims. We had the pleasure of speaking to Yossi Segal, Marketing Executive, about some of the significant benefits Brian Barr Solicitors can bring to its clients. 'Our experience of and sensitivity to the nuances of complex personal injury claims, particularly those involving chronic pain puts us ahead of other firms.' Indeed, with most of their clients having developed fibromyalgia, CRPS or another pain condition following a road traffic accident, accident at work, slip or trip, or stress at work, this kind of acute sensitivity to their clients’ needs is an essential part of Brian Barr Solicitors’ work.\n\nThey are dedicated to developing good, trusting relationships with their clients, offering them access to leading experts whose understanding of chronic pain and serious injury is second to none. 'What’s more, we have an unrivalled ability to obtain maximum compensation for claims that other solicitors may significantly undervalue,' explained Yossi. 'This area of law and medicine is highly contentious, with defendants frequently valuing claims at no more than a few thousand pounds.'\n\nWith unparalleled expertise in supporting chronic pain claimants, Brian Barr Solicitors is now extending this proficiency to areas including serious and catastrophic injuries, as well as brain injuries. Here, Brain Barr Solicitors will work tirelessly to ensure that clients are compensated for what they lost due to an accident. They will provide access to medical experts, rehabilitation services, and therapies which will help recovery and ensure the claimant has aids, equipment and assistance for the future.\n\nAlways committed to developing significant working relationships, Brian Barr Solicitors attended Naidex in 2017 as a spectator, and in 2018 as an exhibitor. 'Our experience of both years at Naidex was positive, with many valuable connections being made,' said Yossi.\n\nWith over 15 years of expertise in offering outstanding services for their clients, it is evident that Brian Barr Solicitors understands people’s pain as well as they do the law. With a clear passion for helping clients in a caring and professional manner, Brian Barr Solicitors prides itself in offering superior support and advice in a person’s time of need, securing the compensation they deserve.

          "DetailDescription": "Working in potentially explosive atmospheres is hazardous enough without having concerns that the voltage being supplied to temporary lighting is no longer within certified limits.\n\nHow can anyone be absolutely sure what voltage is being supplied, especially in a typical, long cable FPSO situation? Could it be one volt more or less than the certified safe range? Reassurance is now available from Wolf Safety, whose latest technology gives an immediate warning when voltage either slips below or exceeds certified limits, even by just one volt.\n\nTheir SOVI™ technology – it stands for Safe Optimal Voltage Indicator – removes all doubt, giving operators the confidence that temporary lighting is operating safely, effectively and at the optimal voltage. \n\nUnique to Wolf Safety products, the ground-breaking technology is now incorporated into its ATEX and IECEx certified Hazardous Area Temporary Lighting range, further enhancing safety in potentially explosive atmospheres.\n\nIt also ensures that a lighting solution is operating effectively and at the optimal voltage. SOVI™ is already incorporated into the LINKEX™ LED TEMPORARY LUMINAIRE LX-400 range as well as the recently updated, market leading LINKEX™ WF-300XL LED FLOODLITE range. New for 2019 is the LINKEX™ LED ATEX EMERGENCY TEMPORARY LUMINAIRE, which features the unique technology. In the unlikely event that a light is operating at a voltage above the maximum certified limit, the beam will pulse from bright to dim; giving a clear warning that action is needed to ensure that work can continue safely in the hazardous area. However, it is more likely that issues will arise at the lower end of the voltage range. For example, if too many 24 volt lights are strung together and the transformer is overloaded, voltage could drop below the optimal level and light output will reduce incrementally as the input voltage falls.\n\nIf this does occur, SOVI™ ensures the light will pulse bright, indicating that the lamp is not within its certified voltage range, though the light itself is still safe as it is certified down to zero volts. \n\nThis differs from other ATEX lights, where a reduced voltage supply can lead to the light operating outside the certified, safe voltage range. Wolf Safety’s clear, visual warning system and ‘plug in and play’ format means there is no safety risk in connecting too many lights together.\n\nMichael Morley, Wolf Safety’s Technical Director, says, ‘Even if operators are working some distance from the lamp they are alerted about a power supply issue and made aware that something needs to be done. If the voltage is too high, the product must be turned off. Without SOVI™, the operator has to check the voltage is correct and safe, while continuing to work in the hazardous area.\n\n‘In some cases a qualified electrician has to be on hand to do the checks but not with SOVI™, which tells operators when there’s an issue. If input voltage falls below the optimal level SOVI™ lets operators know, so they can stay safe.’\n\nFull details of Wolf Safety temporary lighting incorporating SOVI™ can be found at: \nwww.wolfsafety.com/temporary-lighting",

          "DetailDescription": "Within this issue of Business and Industry Today, we have selected Vision\nEngineering as our Optical Instrumentation Company of the Year for their\nongoing commitment to providing the market with the most technologically\nadvanced, ergonomically optimised optical and digital inspection and\nmetrology technology.\n\nVision Engineering is a global, leading-edge manufacturer of unique\nergonomic stereo microscopes, digital 3D visualisation equipment and non-\ncontact measuring systems. Vision Engineering has over 60 years of\nexperience, starting out as a specialist optical sub-contractor for large\nBritish companies including Rolls Royce, Vickers, Ferranti and GEC, the\ncompany has seen consistent growth since its inception.\n\nFounder Rob Freeman started out as a toolmaker, working as a race mechanic\nwith the Jaguar Racing Team. Whilst at Jaguar Rob developed an optical\ninstrument called a borescope, for the inspection of internal race engine\nparts without the need to dismantle the engine. In 1958 he established\nVision Engineering as a platform to develop his growing passion for optics\napplied to manufacturing technology.\n\nVision Engineering has subsequently established a well-earned reputation\nfor developing and manufacturing revolutionary optical equipment. One of\nVision Engineering’s most notable products is the Mantis; the world’s first\nstereo microscope without an eyepiece, introduced in 1994. Mark Curtis,\nVision Engineering Managing Director comments “The Original Mantis filled\nthe gap between a bench magnifier and a microscope. Mantis was an ergonomic\nleap forward in optical inspection technology, going on to win numerous\ndesign and innovation awards. In a very short space of time Mantis became\nthe benchmark for high performance stereo magnification, and since then,\nVision Engineering has consistently developed leading-edge stereo\ninspection and metrology products to improve productivity and quality for\nmany thousands of customers”.\n\nSince creating  this unseen before, innovative stereo microscope, Vision\nEngineering has consistently challenged the capabilities of optical\ninstrumentation and has received ongoing industry recognition for their\nequipment. In 1996, Rob was awarded the MBE, in recognition of his services\nto the British optical industry.\n\nLocated in Send, Surrey, Vision Engineering now operates from an impressive\nstate of the art manufacturing facility and offices, opened in 2017. In\naddition to the UK site, Vision Engineering also has multiple overseas\nsubsidiaries in countries including America, France, Italy, China, Japan\nand India. The company also has a global network of fully trained\ndistributors.\n\nWith global reach and a clear market advantage in its field, Vision\nEngineering is at the forefront of optical instrumentation technology.\nProviding the highest performing, comfortable and easy to use ergonomically\noptimised inspection and metrology equipment, Vision Engineering provides\nsolutions for a whole host of different industry sectors, including:\nmanufacturing, electronics, automotive, aerospace, life science, medical\ndevice manufacture and many more.  “As an international company with over\n230 staff members, 120 in the UK and the rest located in numerous locations\nglobally, we have been exporting successfully for many years. Despite all\nof the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and other international issues, we\nremain dedicated to growing and expanding to ensure we are always giving\nour customers the latest advancements in ergonomics and technology.” Mark\nCurtis said.\n\nOne of the main benefits of Vision Engineering’s equipment is its ease of\nuse for operators.  Designed to enhance the operator’s productivity, Vision\nEngineering’s equipment is the perfect tool for a more efficient, durable\nand productive work experience. “Microscopes that use an eyepiece require\nusers to hold a fixed viewing position, which can lead to stiffness in the\nneck muscles.” Mark explained, “Typically, the operators of this type of\nequipment will be doing repetitive tasks for up to eight hours a day, so\nVision Engineering’s guiding principle has been making sure that its\nequipment is easy and comfortable to use for long periods of time, thus\nimproving operator comfort and efficiency.”\n\nVision Engineering’s eyepiece-less equipment is an example of how the\ncompany listens and responds to the needs of the market; creating equipment\nthat enhances efficiency by enabling users to have an easier observation\nwithout needing to precisely align their eyes with eyepieces. Greater\nfreedom of movement is allowed which leads to more relaxed muscles,\nreducing the risk of neck and back strain. Another notable benefit of the\nequipment is that ergonomically optimised microscopes reduce eye fatigue,\nimprove hand-to-eye coordination, and minimise the risk of repetitive\nstrain injuries. Mark stated that, “Vision Engineering is a company fuelled\nby progression and innovation, ensuring our products are designed to\ndeliver optimal working conditions for its customers”.\n\nThis year has seen some significant achievements for the global company;\nspeaking with Mark he detailed some of the best achievements and new\ndevelopments for Vision Engineering, “2019 has been an exciting year for\nnew product launches.  The launch of our innovative new glasses-free\ndigital 3D visualisation technology, the Deep Reality Viewer (DRV), has\nseen us move the visualisation and inspection markets forward in a\ncompletely new way. DRV delivers digital stereo 3D imaging in a unique,\nadvanced presentation system providing fully interactive real time natural\n3D viewing and visualisation with outstanding depth perception.  Not only\nis the long-standing conundrum of glasses-free digital 3D viewing solved,\nbut the DRV also opens up new collaboration opportunities through its\nability to send and receive 3D HD digital images across digital networks in\nreal time. This revolutionary, next-generation 3D technology is a result of\nVision Engineering’s sustained investment in optical and digital R&D. We’ve\nalso strengthened our metrology portfolio with the launch of our first\nfully automated 3-axis video measurement system, the LVC 400. It’s designed\nto measure large components or multiple small components, quickly, easily\nand accurately, and, in keeping with our core principles it offers faster\nmeasurement and high accuracy levels, combined with ease of use for\noperators.”\n\nIn terms of the company’s future plans, Vision Engineering is dedicated to\nmaking 2020 another year of innovation and new product availability.\nContinuing its dedication to research and development and pushing the\nboundaries of optical technology, Vision Engineering has some exciting new\nproduct launches lined up for the New Year.  “It’s an exciting time in our\nmarkets at the moment. Without question DRV is the next big thing, and we\nare taking this technology and addressing the drive for real time\ncommunicability found in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0.”\nMark continued, “We are  sharing the information that our products\ngenerate, making it available to people no matter where they are, enabling\nnew opportunities for valuable collaboration whether the other person is in\nthe next room or the next continent. The DRV-Z1’s sharing capability\ncreates exciting opportunities to collaborate with real time digital\nconnectivity from multiple locations across the globe.”\n\nAfter a successful year for the company, we spoke to Mark about how Vision\nEngineering feels upon receiving this award, he told us that, “2019 has\nbeen a real success for Vision Engineering both in terms of our new product\nlaunches and also the market reaction to our innovative new technologies.\nIt has been a year of recognition of our technological achievements,\nparticularly with DRV and also validation of our guiding ‘user-centred’\nphilosophy and exemplified by this award for our company.  We are delighted\nto receive Business and Industry Today’s ‘Company of the Year’ award – what\na great way to round off 2019!”\n\nFor any more information please see details below.\nT 01483 248300\nwww.visioneng.com\n\n",

          "DetailDescription": "There are many things you should be aware of before you can go to a hazardous area to perform a calibration. There are different levels of hazardous areas and different levels of calibration equipment.\n\nWhat is a hazardous area?\nA hazardous area is anywhere (indoors or outdoors) that contains, or may contain, flammable substances. The flammable substance may be a liquid, gas, vapor or dust. \n\nIn such a hazardous area, an explosion or fire is possible if all three conditions of the 'Explosion Triangle' are met. These three conditions are fuel (a flammable substance), source of ignition (or heat) and oxygen (air).\n\nFlammable and combustible liquids\nWhat are flammable and combustible liquids? Generally speaking, they are liquids that can burn. They may be gasoline, diesel fuel, solvents, cleaners, paints, chemicals, etc. \n\nFlashpoint and autoignition temperatures are also often discussed.\n\nFlashpoint is the lowest temperature of a liquid at which it produces sufficient vapor to form an ignitable mixture with air. With a spark or enough heat, it will ignite.\n\nAutoignition temperature is the lowest temperature at which a liquid will ignite even without an external source of ignition. Most commonly, flammable and combustible liquids have autoignition temperatures in the range of 572 °F to 1022 °F (300 °C to 550 °C). However, there are liquids that have an auto-ignition temperature as low as 392 °F (200 °C) or less.\n\nBased on their flashpoint, liquids are classified as flammable or combustible. Flammable liquids may ignite at normal working temperatures, while combustible liquids burn at higher temperatures. Often 100 °F (37.8 °C) is considered as the temperature limit. Flammable liquids have a flashpoint below 100 °F and combustible liquids above. To be more precise, flammable and combustible liquids themselves do not burn, it is the vapours that burn. More precisely, it is the mixture of the vapours and air that burns.\n\nThere are also limits of the concentration within which the mixture can burn. If the concentration of the mixture is too low (too thin) it will not burn; the same is true if the concentration is too high (too rich). The limits are known as lower and upper explosive limits (LEL and UEL).\n\nIt is good to remember that some liquids may have a rather low flashpoint. For example, gasoline has a flashpoint as low as c. -40 °F (-40 °C). It produces enough vapours in normal environmental conditions to make a burnable mixture with air. Combustible liquids have a flashpoint way above normal environmental conditions and therefore they have to be heated before they will ignite.\n\nVarious protection techniques\nTo prevent an explosion, one of the three elements of the Explosion Triangle should be eliminated. In practice, eliminating the source of ignition would be the most sensible. There are various techniques in electrical equipment that make them safer for use in hazardous areas.\n\nThese different techniques fall into two main categories: eliminate the source of ignition (Exe, Exi) or isolate the source of ignition (Exd, Exp, Exq, Exo, Exm).\n \nIntrinsically safe technique\nIntrinsically safe equipment is designed so that it will not provide enough energy to generate sparks and excessively high surface temperatures, even in the case of a fault in the device. \n\nInside an Exi device, the Exm ('Encapsulated') technique may also be used for certain parts of the equipment (as in a battery pack).\n\nFinally… The world’s most accurate calibrator and communicator for hazardous areas\nThe Beamex MC6-Ex is an ATEX and IECEx certified field calibrator and communicator that safeguards engineers operating within hazardous areas. With a robust IP65 rated casing, the MC6EX is certified for use in the harshest of environments, up to and including Zone 0.

          "DetailDescription": "Here at Business and Industry Today we are extremely pleased to be presenting Vision Research with our highly coveted High Speed Digital Imaging Specialist of the Year award. We spoke with the company’s Media Sales Manager John Hannaford, who was happy to tell us more about the brand, the team, and their most significant movements – both past and present – in further detail.\n\nIt all began in 1950, which is when the enterprise was first founded as the Photographic Analysis Company courtesy of an enthusiastic engineer who wanted to focus on a niche market (research obtainment through meticulous photography processes) that hadn’t been extensively explored in previous times. Continued growth enabled the formation of Vision Research, which was established by the Jantzen family in New Jersey in 1994, and proceedings were further supported by the opening of a UK branch in 2007 by John Hannaford and Jolyon Cleaves. \n\nThe industry frontrunner, which can be found in Bedford at the Priory Business Park, is dedicated to the manufacture and supply of a first-rate, quality line of digital high speed video cameras, known as “Phantom Cameras”. The dependable and intelligent equipment has been known to ‘add new dimension to the sense of sight’ and is widely appreciated for its slow-motion replay capabilities.\n\nThe cameras are designed to capture, visualise, and analyse movements that are too fast for the perception of either the human eye or standardised cameras. Vision Research’s cameras are employed in a variety of businesses and industries (military, automotive, industrial, media, and academia factions being several core examples). Its wide-ranging customer base includes the likes of Ford, Rolls Royce Aero Engines, QinetiQ, Thatcham and the BBC.\n\n“We are seen as the market leader in this business,” John informed us. “Our cameras produce images of superior quality which, when coupled with our streamlined workflow, make Phantom the go-to choice in this market. Our equipment is easy to use and the superior sensor technology incorporated offers a very low noise level in the production of clean, high speed images.\n\n“We haven’t been through any changes in recent times in terms of the business structure, but we did see some segments slow in Q4 of 2015 into the first half of the year, particularly in some of the industrial segments (as has been the case with many companies). Growth was not easy to come by with the current economic climate, so we had to rely on innovation to ensure success.  We have seen several bright spots with the new products that were launched. This includes the Phantom VEO product family (released this summer), which has been very successful, and the Phantom Miro N-series, which we launched in late October.” \n\nThe Phantom VEO cameras, with 4 models and 2 body style options, allow customers to pick exactly what they need. The VEO family is very useful in scientific and industrial applications as they can be utilised for varying tasks (such as analysis, material testing, and defense research). These cameras are compact and have many impressive features including programmable I/0, CFast 2.0 media, SDI and HDMI video outputs and a large recording buffer. Being compact and cost-effective means that clients can choose the best tool for them whilst considering their individual budget and environment. Regardless of the performance level and body style selected, companies can rest assured that with these remarkable five-inch cubes they will receive the best results in terms of speed and resolution.\n\nThe Phantom® Miro® N-Series, meanwhile, is an exciting development for Vision Research as the company’s smallest evolution of digital high speed camera. Measuring just 32mm x 32mm x 28mm, this product can be mounted pretty much anywhere because of its detachable head and ability to withstand impacts up to 170G, making it a great tool for the automotive and aerospace industries. Its performance is not, however, hampered by its size, as the Miro N5 operates as any other Phantom camera would, with great flexibility and reliability.\n\nThe device can deliver 560 frames-per-second (fps) at full resolution (768x600) and incorporates many expected features, such as Extreme Dynamic Range (EDR) for incomparable image quality in demanding areas with high-contrast lighting conditions. In addition to this there is a fixed aperture that accepts miniature S-mount lenses, which are available in various fields of view.\n\n“We are a technology driven company that will continue to push technology limits with new innovations,” commented John when asked to detail the organisation’s short term and the long term plans. “We remain optimistic going into 2017, where we will be leveraging our technology into new market spaces through new innovations. Growth will be developed by the creation of new high speed cameras that will enable our customers to discover more and allow them to see what was previously unseen in their research and applications.\n\n“Vision Research is incredibly proud to be selected for this award.  Our team is very dedicated and passionate about what they do and it is a great honour to be recognised by Business and Industry Today.”\n\nVision Research forms part of Ametek, the global leader of material analysis instrumentation, as a spin-off company designing and fabricating high speed electronic imagers differing in the respect that they are not reliant upon photographic film for imaging. \n\nPlease feel free to get in touch with the group today should you require any further information about the brand and/or its Phantom family of electronic imagers. The contact details are supplied below for your reference, should you wish to contact the team by telephone or email, and the website can be consulted if you would prefer to find out more about the solutions available online.",

          "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Sustainability Today, we are proud to announce that ENOTEC GmbH is our Gas Analysis Solution Company of the Month.ENOTEC GmbH is a leading player in the process gas analysis technology, focussed primarily on the development, production and sale of In-Situ gas analysers and interconnected equipment for process control and emission monitoring applications. The analysers are perfectly suited for applications that involve incineration and combustion processes.Established 1980 by Fred Gumprecht in Marienheide near Cologne, Germany, ENOTEC expanded exponentially in product development and production. With subsidiaries in UK, USA and Belarus, the company continues to offer global expertise, with localised, regional support.Among many others, the target industries include coal, gas and oil-fired power plants, refineries, chemical and petrochemical plants, cement and steel plants, refuse, biomass and sludge incinerators, paper/pulp manufactories, waste heat boilers, drying processes and marine engines. The precision-driven ENOTEC products are designed to operate efficiently in high flue gas temperatures and high dust load environments, as well as corrosive or reducing atmospheres.ENOTEC’s compliancy to the quality management system ISO 9001 ensures that the gas-sensing analysers provide reliable, accurate values. Furthermore, a SIL 2 (1oo1 selection) functional safety certificate is available for the O2 sensor. On request and under certain conditions, a QAL1 certification can be issued for O2 monitoring as part of a CEMS.We caught up with Angie Niño, Digital Marketing Manager, to find out more about ENOTEC’s gas analysers, “The OXITEC® 5000 can measure the excess O2 directly after a combustion process to permanently control the air-fuel ratio. ENOTEC develops and produces their own zirconia based O2 sensors, which are particularly robust, remain gas-tight due to a special soldering technique and have an average life expectancy of 7 to 8 years in typical combustion-related applications.”Moreover, ENOTEC’s range of EX-probes and electrical control units permits measurements in designated explosion areas. Besides the European ATEX certification for zones 1/2, the analysers are certified according to the international IECEx regulations, which enables the worldwide use of the ENOTEC systems.For example, the explosion-prove COMTEC 6000 GasEx probe embodies an additional COe sensor (COe = sum of all combustible gas components such as CO. H2, CxHy, etc.). Excess O2 and COe levels can be adjusted down to a minimum, enabling optimal fuel efficiency. The precise combined In-Situ measurement allows immediate reaction to changes in the flue gas composition, which is ideal for a safe operation, especially in refineries.Arising from the COMTEC set-up, ENOTEC has developed the SILOTEC, a system to monitor the inertisation of silos (e.g. coal storage) and early detection of smouldering fires.Recently ENOTEC also displayed its CEMTEC rotary kiln extraction probe at the 2023 Global CemProducer Conference and Expo in Munich, Germany. Following the exhibition, trade delegates visited the refurbished Burglengenfeld Heidelberg Cement plant, to see the sophisticated state-of-the-art CEMTEC technology in action. It is designed for extreme harsh process conditions (temperatures up to 1400°C and dust loads up to 2000g/m³), having an availability of more than 95%.ENOTEC has been a global leader of precision-driven process gas analysers for over 40 years and as Angie Niño comments, “Due to the constantly evolving market for emissions and process analysers, ENOTEC is decidedly committed to stay at the forefront of this evolution by strongly investing in research and development for future innovation.”For more information, see the UK Sales office details below:T +44 (0)844 247 0102enotec.uk@enotec.comwww.enotec.com",

The organisation is committed to members and member companies promoting best practice and uniform service delivered in relation to restoration and repair, after damage occurring to residential and commercial properties.The BDMA hosts a bi-annual conference to showcase the most up-to-date developments within the wider industry sector. The conference event welcomes a wide variety of manufacturers, insurers, and technicians from across the industry. The most recent BDMA Conference was held in June 2022 at the East Midlands Conference Centre. The theme of the Conference, ‘The Roadmap to Sustainable Resilience’ remains highly topical – both in terms of geographical climate change but also in relation to personal mental health resilience. Our headline speaker, Simon Reeve, excellently covered both aspects in his informative, interesting, and motivational opening keynote speech.As we return to a ‘new normal’ after the pandemic, we are reminded once again of the equally significant issue of climate change. Ours is an industry that tackles two sides of the coin – we are the ones who respond to the damaging outcomes of extreme weather events caused by environmental change, and we are the ones who must choose damage limitation and stabilisation methods that will allow us to protect our natural resources and environment into the future.The BDMA has seen a change in attitude towards the way services are delivered – from remote monitoring, resilience, reduction of strip out, to a return to restoration – the market is moving towards more sustainable solutions. The BDMA will continue to focus on resilience, sustainable best practice, and in particular ‘build back better’ emphasised by the continued delivery of our accreditation training modules. Our industry is likely to grow in significance as extreme weather forces more flooding, more heatwaves and fires, and more extreme rainfall events.For more information, please contact Sophie Bennett on: 01858 414278, email: info@bdma.org.uk or visit: www.bdma.org.uk",

          "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Sustainability Today, we have selected Stuart Canvas Group as the recipient of our Industry Excellence Award.Stuart Canvas Group is a long established and very experienced textile finisher and custom-made covering solutions manufacturer. Based in Warrington, the company was founded in 1971 and its sister company, Mudfords, was founded in 1832. Headquartered in Warrington alongside one of its production centres, Stuart Canvas Group also has a production centre in Sheffield and a distribution centre in Wardle. The company has approximately 100,000sqft of purpose-built manufacturing facilities across these three sites.Stuart Canvas Group specialises in the manufacture and design of bespoke coverings for a range of sectors including industrial manufacturing, haulage, schools, military and home use.   “Many UK based manufactures are facing increased storage issues and protecting their products adequately during both summer and winter months, due to unpredictable weather conditions. Stuart Canvas can offer bespoke storage solutions and products to help companies protect their raw resources and equipment.” – Craig Groves, Key Accounts Director. The company also owns Mudfords and JMS Cricket, and these established brands have brought extra capability   to Stuart Canvas group due to their experience and extra diversity of products and services. These range of sports covers are widely used, at Wimbledon as well as cricket grounds around the country. In addition, cricket products, nets, and sight screens are produced for every level of the game from school cricket, through to test match venues.Stuart Canvas Group works with many blue-chip companies from around the country and exports to over 25 countries. With no job too big or too small, the company’s client base stretches as far as the West Indies, Hong Kong and California. As the group has grown and developed, it has invested heavily in new machines and technology in order to remain at the forefront of the industry. Stuart Canvas Group produce bespoke coverings to help the transportation of equipment between sites, thus preventing damage. These covers can also help when equipment or plant machinery that is on site as they protect against the weather, industrial dust and manufacturing overspill. To further customise the covers, the company use a wide range of materials and offer bespoke printing enabling each cover to be custom made to the client requirements. One of its primary products is the retractable aggregate bays which are designed to reduce the wastage of raw materials. These bespoke retractable roofing tunnels are custom made to fit existing or new aggregate bays. There is both a cost-effective manual operating system and a remote-controlled electric system for these roofing solutions that help reduce wastage by up to 30% by protecting raw material from the elements. Sustainability is at the heart of all work undertaken by Stuart Canvas Group and Marketing Manager Steven Ball stated, “our goal is to help other companies reduce their wastage of raw manufacturing materials and prolong the life of their equipment.” Many of the systems installed at some of the UK’s largest concrete, asphalt and brickwork manufacturing plants also feature a new motorised system which was pioneered by Stuart Canvas Group. This allows the cover to be retracted over the top of each bay quickly and efficiently with a single push of a button. This system then creates a watertight seal that protects the material underneath the tunnel. Whether large or small, fixed or retractable, Stuart Canvas Group offer a solution to all clients’ storage needs and advise on how to create the best additional workspace both internally and externally. The tunnels can be produced as mobile or static workshops and can be designed to be dismantled and assembled should they need to be relocated in the future.Offering a problem solving solution to all clients’ needs, the company can deliver design solutions to address these problems.  One of these being a CAD drawing service for its products that is offered in-house if the design of a product requires it. With over 50 years of experience, the group can ensure that all of its solutions are custom-made, and by offering a full service including a site visit, design concept and installation, clients are guaranteed the service their business requires.One of the company’s prestigious clients is the iconic Wimbledon tennis championships held every June in SW19. Stuart Canvas Group has been supplying equipment to the tournament for over 30 years, including the championship nets and posts andthe green perimeter fences for each court that helps separate the courts and create safe areas for spectators.Stuart Canvas Group provide equipment that is nationally distinguishable throughout the UK. Most people would recognise the green rain covers that are unrolled every time the rain falls at Wimbledon. The covers are manufactured in-house by the company and features a specialist material that allows sunlight through without burning the grass while continuing to remain waterproof.Looking to the future, Stuart Canvas Group will continue to remain innovative in its design solutions in order to keep up with the demand of its diverse customer base. and one example of this was during COVID-19, when the group was able to use some of its textile manufacturing knowledge to produce over 100,000 pieces of PPE for the NHS.Upon receiving our Industry Excellence Award, Steven said “with so many years of experience in providing solutions for companies throughout a variety of sectors, it is a thrill to receive this award. It demonstrates the vast knowledge and skill base that the company has gained from our dedicated staff.” For further information:T 01925 814525sales@stuartcanvas.co.uk www.stuartcanvas.co.uk",

          "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Sustainability Today, we are very pleased to announce Ulster Shredders as our Industrial Shredding Company of the Month.Based at Cogry Works in Castledawson, Northern Ireland, Ulster Shredders was founded in 1970 by Jack Gowdy, and was initially established to work with the aerospace and textile industry. The company has recently completed a 10,000ft2 expansion, taking its manufacturing Headquarters’ capacity up to 43,000ft2, and the new workspace is a dedicated machine shop housing a state-of-the-art machining centre where the in-house production team produce all machine components for its product range. Building on the rich heritage of over 50 years of engineering excellence, this expansion houses world class machinery, for the tailor-made production of precision machined components used in the manufacture of the company’s product range.Ulster Shredders deliver bespoke shredding solutions, across the whole of Ireland, the UK, into Europe, and even internationally. All shredders are designed and manufactured in-house at the headquarters, where the company produces a variety of machines, and also manufactures and supplies spare parts to all of its machines, and these are stocked and dispatched globally also.Ulster Shredders service personnel ensure that it has the ability to provide an extensive range of services when customers require them. Whether one piece of equipment or many, the success of client’s business is important, and the highly skilled engineers are involved from commissioning equipment, inspections, through to regular maintenance to keep all purchased products fully operational. Ulster Shredders also provides a comprehensive training programme for all machine operators, equipping them with the correct skills, knowledge, and methods to operate our machines at the highest level.With clients coming from across the waste and recycling industry, including processing and manufacturing companies, the machines can shred a wide variety of products including paper and plastics, biomass, hard drives, computers, glass and wood, among many other things. Managing Director, Enda Cushnahan, commented, “Any customer can come to us and have any material tested through our shredders first, this helps us to see the output material post shred. This is why all of our shredders are totally bespoke as we can change and adjust them all to suit the application needed.”The success of a shredder depends not only on the horsepower which drives it, but also on how the product to be shredded is fed and discharged from it. Ulster Shredders designs and supplies stand-alone machines as well as complete turnkey recycling systems, tailored to the customer’s specific needs, and the company’s Design and R&D Department have repeatedly implemented cost effective solutions to satisfy customers’ unique requirements.Ulster Shredders employs up-to-date 2D and 3D CAD systems to support the design and research and development of its products, and it also utilises Autodesk Inventor, a 3D solid modelling and 2D draughting software package. This allows virtual 3D modelling of components, along with the creation of 2D manufacture drawings directly from the model - thus ensuring very high design and manufacturing integrity and reduced product design lead times. In addition, utilising AutoCAD software, the company can readily interface with other third-party software, providing direct engineering information transfer with our customers.While there are other companies offering similar products to Ulster Shredders, it has remained at the forefront of the industry for a number of reasons. Enda continued, “Our relationship with our customers has been at the heart of our success. We engage with them right from the beginning of the product testing process in our R&D facility, through to design, build and after-sales support.”Current products include the unique and versatile U5 machine, bespoke for the destruction of electronic media, tapes and hard disc drives, through to the U45 which offers a wide range of options, including Standard, Short Bed and Long Bed chassis configurations. However, recently Ulster Shredders has developed the T-50 Tetra 4-Shaft Shredder, which it launched at the world’s leading IFAT 2022 Trade Fair Messe München. All its other shredders are twin shaft, and this introduction of the 4-Shaft model to the range has been extremely successful with much interest in the UK as it has been produced in Northern Ireland. This means that lead times are shorter, and customers can call to check in and keep up-to-date on the whole process.Designed for maximum performance and high productivity, the T-50 has been efficiently designed as machine operator friendly and engineered to shred in different formats, delivering an economical solution to customers. Consistent with the well-established low speed high torque design on the twin shaft machines, the T-50 delivers a low noise and dust pollution shredder, with a well-developed direct drive system powered by two electric motors directly driving the four shafts through a series of reduction gears.The T-50 has been designed to allow versatile feeding from all sides via conveyor belt, forklift, lifting and tipping devices or by hand with a pusher available as an optional extra. Its robust design can fit easily into any customers’ production line as an upstream or downstream shredding solution allowing for flexible material discharge options. It is also suitable for a wide range of challenging materials including, mixed material streams, plastics, piping, & wood focusing on delivering a high throughput to a regulated particle size. Ulster Shredders displayed the T-50 at this year’s RWM & Letsrecycle Live exhibition at Birmingham’s NEC among other trade shows.Looking to the future, Enda said, “We have a number of plans in the pipeline, mainly to grow our product range and to continue to grow our profile including expansion into more countries, and our 4-shaft has been an excellent start to these plans.” With over 50 years of experience, Ulster Shredders is the market leader in the shredding industry.T 028 7965 0050info@ulstershredders.comwww.ulstershredders.com",

We\nrecognise the important practical and environmental benefits of rail\nfreight, so we are pleased that this new facility will allow a greater\nrange of slate materials to be delivered across the UK in a more\nsustainable manner. We are delighted to have worked with the Welsh\nGovernment and our partners to invest in this high-quality freight facility\nin North Wales.”Jess Lippett, senior regional freight manager at Network Rail, said, “Rail\nfreight is a vital part of our infrastructure, providing a fast, green,\nsafe and efficient way of transporting goods.“We’ve worked closely with our partners at Breedon and in Welsh Government\nto get Llandudno Junction open for business, ensuring that we can carry\nslate aggregate by rail and therefore reduce the number of lorries on the\nroad and cut carbon emissions. The recent slate loading shows how we can\nwork together to have a positive impact on the environment and the\neconomy.”John Smith, chief executive officer at GB Railfreight, who are operating\nthe trains, added, “We’re delighted to be transporting slate aggregates\nfrom Llandudno Junction. It is encouraging to see the Government and the\nprivate sector come together to enable a service that will transport key\nconstruction materials, create employment opportunities, and drive local\ngrowth. This new service will demonstrate the commercial, environmental and\nsafety benefits of transporting goods by rail freight.”In addition to road and rail, Welsh Slate also ships slate aggregates from\nPort Penrhyn in Bangor to the UK and Europe.For a video of the railhead in action, go to: https://youtu.be/YngPcNv03I8www.breedongroup.com\n",

          "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Sustainability Today, we are pleased to announce Compact & Bale as our Waste Recycling Machinery Company of the Month.After selling print finishing equipment, materials handling systems, then balers in the UK for over 12 years, Steve Burnett started Compact & Bale in July 2000 and has never looked back! Based in Tonbridge, Kent, Compact & Bale Ltd are an award-winning company that supplies 100s of machines and collects 1,000s of tonnes of material for recycling and recovery each year.Its clients include leading retail, manufacturing, warehouse and distribution businesses together with local authorities, hospitals, shopping centres, garden centres and recyclers, and the company is ISO9001, ISO14001, CHAS, Safe Contractor and Altius accredited. It also offers 24/7 support from its online helpdesk, and with its own team of engineers, can be trusted to deliver on what is promised.As UK partners for Europe’s leading manufacturers, Compact and Bale provide a comprehensive and full range of innovative compactors, cardboard balers, shredders, wheelie bin compactors and liquid draining machines to some of Britain’s biggest businesses including Ikea, Peacocks, Monsoon, O2 Centre, Cotton Traders and Bodyshop in addition to numerous hospitals, shopping centres and councils.Sold in over 53 countries around the world, the company’s compactors and balers are of the highest quality and with their reduced lifetime cost, provide the greatest return on investment.  The compactor solutions include a range of market first innovations that do not just provide significant direct environmental and financial benefit, but also save on labour with its ‘Automate to Save’ range.Compact & Bale’s range of Waste Compactors use 24-38+ tonnes of pressure, achieving up to 10:1 compaction ratio, to consistently compact high payloads on a wide range of waste materials. Steve commented, “These machines help clients to keep their costs down but their payloads high – all of our machines are quality built to CHEM standards and are typically loaded by hand or automatic bin lifter from ground or dock level.”There is also a wide range of Baling machines, which can help companies deal with waste much more quickly, and to avoid their skips being full of mixed waste, much of which could be recycled if it were kept separate. Baling waste like cardboard, polythene, film, paper and plastic saves companies paying for disposal, reduces handling on site and, in many cases, enables them to sell waste by the tonne for recycling. It also reduces the number of collections required, cutting site traffic, local environmental impact and overall CO2 emissions.Compact and Bale also have an enviable reputation for the highest quality refurbishments. The workshop and service team really care and produce the finest recycled recycling machinery. For example, the Strautmann Umwelttechnik GmbH PP1207, ‘Battleship Built’ mill size baler users 58t pressure, sits in a compact footprint and can compact cardboard, polythene, pp crates or bags for recycling all day, every day, for 20 plus years!For waste companies that rent balers and compactors to their customers, and pay monthly rental invoices for years, yet never actually own the machinery, this will add up to a lot of money spent on equipment hire. However, as Steve continued, “We encourage companies to look at things differently. If they buy the highest quality, most reliable, longest lasting machines on the market, they can rent them out themselves, get client’s work and their rental will repay the outlay. This means that they firstly get return of investment, then return on investment!”There are obviously similar companies in the industry offering similar products and services, but thanks to its partnerships with Europe’s leading manufacturers of intelligent compaction equipment, Compact & Bale supply automated waste handling systems that free up staff and cut handling costs, labour and carbon footprint.

          "DetailDescription": "With the UK Competitions and Market Authority (CMA) now investigating a\nnumber of brands over their green claims, companies should be on high alert\nto avoid misleading customers with spurious environmental claims. One area\nwhere we have noticed bold, if questionable, claims being made is the ‘zero\nto landfill’ promises so often emblazoned on waste company vehicles or\ntouted in waste reports. The recent Zero Waste Europe report Incineration\nResidues in the EU: Quantities and fates should give waste producers pause\nfor thought. The report found that between 11.3 and 16 million tonnes of\nincineration residues are landfilled annually, of which around 6.4 million\ntonnes are from municipal waste. Incineration absolutely has its place –\nthere are waste streams that can have no other fate and some unrecyclable\nwaste being incinerated for energy production is sensible. But given that\nregardless of the reason for incineration there are residues and bottom ash\nthat will then require landfilling we should view all claims of ‘zero to\nlandfill’ with extreme scepticism.It's easy to understand how these claims have been appealing both to waste\nmanagement companies wanting to tout their environmental credentials and\nwaste producers wanting to implement ‘zero waste’ policies and targets. And\nits easy to understand how these claims have gone unchecked and become the\nnorm given the current state of transparency, or lack thereof, in waste\nsupply chains and the almost complete absence of quality data on waste,\nespecially commercial and industrial waste.We know how hard it is for waste producers to truly understand the fate of\ntheir waste currently. Waste management companies are often cagey about\nsharing information on the onward and end destination of the waste they\nmanage for clients. Some of this is down to worries about sharing\n‘commercially sensitive’ information, despite the fact that knowing the end\nfate of their waste is a waste producer’s legal duty of care. From our\nexperience I would also wage that for a lot of waste management companies\nthey also lack the digital systems to track the waste they manage\naccurately. This creates a challenge since waste producers are now\nexpecting increasingly detailed waste reporting from their waste\ncontractors and large waste contracts are being won and lost on the basis\nof the quality of data the customer can access.Add to this the soon-to-be-introduced mandatory digital waste tracking that\nDefra consulted on earlier this year and there is a clear necessity for\nwaste management companies to implement digital systems to run their\nbusinesses. Once the new system is rolled out regulators will have access\nto accurate, near real-time data about every waste transaction. Waste\nproducers and waste management companies will be able to see all the\ntransactions in their waste supply chain. When this happens I think we will\nsee a lot of companies having to revise their zero to landfill claims as it\nwill be clear that simply isn’t true in many instances.Given we can’t define an accurate baseline from the current data available,\nmaybe there should be an ‘amnesty’ on prior waste claims, with businesses\nbeing encouraged to start with a fresh slate, using the new data that will\nbe available through waste tracking to set new targets and measure their\nprogress accurately and transparently. Without that, companies can expect\nto not only be under scrutiny from the environmental regulators but also at\nrisk of investigation from the CMA. Given the enormous challenges ahead of\nus in the face of the climate emergency we need to be open and transparent\nabout our sustainability efforts and share the learnings that come from\nboth our successes and failures. Better data and digital systems can help\nwith that.T0161 327 2755\nalways@yourdsposal.uk\nwww.dsposal.uk\n",

At Stuart Canvas we have designed and manufactured\ninnovative retractable covering solutions for aggregate bays. The tunnel\nsystem uses custom-made steel framework tracking which allows for quick\ndeployment and retraction.Each tunnel can be operated individually allowing each tunnel to be\npositioned according to the level of raw material being stored. This design\nalso allows for the tunnels to be partially retracted to allow for the\nloading and off-loading of raw material. Each tunnel features custom made\ngutter units that allow for excess water to be directed away from each bay.Many of our systems installed at some of the UK’s largest concrete, asphalt\nand brickwork manufacturing plants also feature our new motorised system\nwhich was pioneered by Stuart Canvas; this allows the cover to be retracted\nover the top of each bay quickly and efficiently with a single push of a\nbutton. This system creates a watertight seal to protect the material\nunderneath the tunnel. Our studies have found that waste can be reduced by\nup to 30% over traditional covering systems.Stuart Canvas has produced retractable tunnels and semi-permanent buildings\nfor the industrial sector for over 20 years.

We explore\nwhy businesses should consider a rainwater harvesting system as an\nalternative to the mains water supply.How does rainwater harvesting work?\nA rainwater harvesting system takes advantage of the frequent rainy weather\nto replace the need to use mains water.Rainwater harvesting can be as simple as filling a water butt with\nrainwater from your property's gutters and using it to water a lawn.However, sophisticated rainwater harvesting systems can produce high-\nquality drinking water through the following three-step process:\nInitial filtration removing twigs, leaves and other debris present in\nrainwater.\nA sedimentation filtration process to remove any other particles present in\nthe water.\nA UV disinfection process to kill any bacteria and pathogens present in the\nwater.Harvested and treated rainwater collected can be safely used in toilets,\nshowers and all other processes that generally use a mains water supply.Reasons your business should consider a rainwater harvesting system\n​​There are plenty of benefits of using rainwater harvesting, from reducing\nyour impact on the environment to saving vast amounts on your water bill:\nReduce your overall water consumption as a business.\nCost-effective.\nReduces the carbon footprint of your business operations.\nSimple to implement and easy to use.\nHarvesting rainwater helps to achieve a BREEAM certification.Businesses have been found they can reduce their overall water consumption\nby 40% using a rainwater harvesting system.Other sustainable water practices for businesses to undertake:\nBorehole water supply: A borehole freshwater system extracts clean water\ndirectly from the ground beneath your property.\nGreywater system: Greywater systems are a recycling method where greywater\nproduced in a property is reused in non-human processes.We hope this information was useful to you; at AquaSwitch, we look to\neducate businesses on how to reduce their water consumption and how to\nbecome a water-efficient business.

          "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Sustainability Today, we are pleased to announce Cromwell Polythene as our Recycling & Waste Management Company of the Month.Cromwell Polythene is an independent, UK family run business that has been supplying and manufacturing products for the capture and containment of waste and recyclables for nearly 40 years. Originally based in Tockwith, near York, Cromwell Polythene is now headquartered in Sherburn in Elmet, Leeds and has a manufacturing and recycling division in Alfreton, Derbyshire. Specialising in waste management, recycling and cleaning industries, Cromwell Polythene also caters to a wide range of sectors including health care, food service, building and construction, and industrial.Established in 1983 by James Lee, Cromwell Polythene’s mission has always been to be the most resourceful company in plastics, supplying products that help make the world cleaner, greener, and more resourceful. Their vision underpins the mission statement, and to this day the company continues to supply a comprehensive range of products with the highest recycled content possible, that are reusable, recyclable, or compostable. The range includes polythene and compostable waste & recycling sacks liners and bags, and packaging film including Single Wound Sheeting, Double wound sheeting and Lay Flat Tubing.“We select the best solution for our customers based on their requirements. Many of our products are CHSA accredited giving our customers the reassurance 'what's on the box is in the box'. Quality standards are ensured by our in-house quality team who test our products before they are released for distribution,” stated Alex Lee, Commercial Director.As well as its extensive product portfolio, Cromwell Polythene also prides itself on setting high standards for its dependable services, reliable knowledge and long-lasting relationships. One notable service is the Polythene Recovery Service, a used polythene recovery service which is used to help its customers be more resource efficient. “Our service is a great way of keeping valuable resources within the circular economy by returning clean polythene packaging to the production cycle. Used polythene is collected from our customers on a back-load basis, then recycled in the UK - by ourselves or by one of our partners. Benefits for customers include reduction of waste disposal costs and regular reporting of packaging returns for recycling,” explained Alex.With the introduction of the new Plastics Packaging Tax due to commence from April 2022, many businesses should be preparing for a new tax that will apply to plastics packaging manufactured in, or imported into the UK, that does not contain at least 30% recycled plastic. Alex commented, “While most Cromwell Polythene products range from 95-100% recycled content, and are not liable to taxation, the increase in demand for recycled content is leading to higher pricing. If 30% recycled content and above is not possible, businesses need to prepare for the additional £200/tonne premium applied to their plastic products. It is important to note that the PPT will also apply to EN13432 accredited compostable plastics. Compostable products shall largely be classed as 'virgin' and therefore subject to the same tax as conventional, fossil-based plastics.” More than 95% of Cromwell Polythene’s products already meet and comply with this new legislation. By manufacturing, producing, selling and using recycled packaging products, Cromwell Polythene is already helping to reduce the levels of virgin materials being sent to landfill.Cromwell Polythene has always been at the forefront of innovation, continuously improving the performance and efficiency of its operations to provide the best solutions for its clients and the industry. 2021 saw many complications and disruptions to lead times and stocking processes. Alex explained some recent changes the business has made to combat these issues, “We have recently consolidated our range to help provide the best solutions to our customers. Our recent efforts in our SKU rationalisation and consolidation project will allow us to stock higher quantities of a rationalised number of lines, thus offering customers ever improving reliability in their supply of quality products at the best price, despite the ongoing disruption further up the chain.”One positive effect from COVID-19 has been the increasing awareness and importance of practicing good cleanliness and hygiene in the workplace. Cromwell Polythene has received substantial demand from particular companies within the healthcare, clinical and specialist waste collection sectors that provided a platform for the business to promote its products and share the importance of good waste management. “Many of the other aftermaths from COVID-19 are still being tackled such as supply chain disruption and increasing costs. Our plans will be well-placed to ensure we are well prepared for the future,” stated Alex.A successful company is nothing without the support, hard work, dedication and loyalty of its customers and employees. In closing, Alex shared his appreciation, “It is always worth thanking our loyal customer base for their ongoing support. As well as our supply partners and in particular the staff who are making everything happen. We have a great team of people at both sites working hard to continually make what we do better.”For more information, see below.T 01977 686868info@cromwellpolythene.co.ukwww.cromwellpolythene.co.uk",

          "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Sustainability Today, we are pleased to announce Revive Environmental International Ltd as our Environmental Services Company of the Month.Established in 2020 by Liam Kearney, CEO, Revive Environmental International Ltd (Revive) remanufacture and develop specialised mobile-environmental equipment for the water, wastewater and sewerage industry. With a commitment to reducing CO2 through its innovative production processes, its specialised mobile-environmental equipment, otherwise known as ‘Units’ offer anything from combination units, recyclers, JetVacs, tankers and more.Revive units are built to last with every vehicle benefitting from additional reinforcements of the OEM subframe, upgrades to the original tank mounts and improvements to the pump supports and hydraulic mounting brackets. “Our whole business model is focused on reduced demand for virgin steel. We remount and remanufacture existing sewer cleaning units creating savings of up to 25 tonnes in CO2 emissions for each unit,” stated Liam.The production of just one 3-axle sewer cleaner through the remanufacturing of existing units, can help many companies across the UK and Ireland take control of their sustainable responsibilities whilst drastically reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. The benefits of one unit from Revive are far more than just financial, Liam commented: “Our team have extensive knowledge of the industry. We can utilise this experience to develop and improve existing issues with the units we revive, all while ensuring that wastage is kept to a minimum. We work with many companies within the water and wastewater sectors from utilities to local government authorities. We aim to attract the interest of environmentally conscientious business owners who are keen to help us reduce unnecessary waste within the industry.”Each unit is also fitted with a new, fully rewired Revive Siemens operating system, heavy-duty stainless-steel upgrades to the control panels, trays and storage boxes, and improvements to the unit’s structure and subframe. Revive re-manufacture a number of combination units, the first being the Revive 15-Cube, designed to handle the most challenging of tasks. This version is fitted with a Kaiser KWP3100 vacuum pump offering unrivalled suction and jetting power and is perfect for stubborn jobs. Secondly, Revive 10/12/14 Cube Combination Units are some of their most versatile and suitable for almost any task within the water and wastewater industry. These unit sizes are ideal for routine daily jobs such as emptying septic tanks, cleaning pipework and general maintenance of the main sewerage network. Thirdly, the Revive 4-Cube Combination Unit is compact and practical and designed for use in densely populated areas. Its small size enables minimal obstruction and allows access to areas many larger units would find difficult.The steel used to manufacture just one new tanker releases over 15 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere, and just one tonne of virgin steel releases up to 1.9 tonnes of CO2. Being non-organic, steel’s ability to be recycled again and again without loss of quality means there will in the future be less demand for virgin raw materials. Revive tankers come in a variety of different sizes and options, and so far, Revive has delivered 3000, 4000 and 4200-gallon tankers to customers across the UK and Ireland.Assuring its customers are playing their part in lowering emissions whilst helping save the planet, Revive has a well-established client portfolio that it is always keen to expand on. Over the past year, Revive has supplied some of the industry’s most well-known companies with their units including DALROD UK, McAllister Group, Lanes Group, and many more. “Revive's facilities are in Thurles, County Tipperary, Ireland. Our UK distributors, Acumec UK are based in Coalville, Leicestershire. Our mantra is that our work can only make a lasting impact if we have the industry's trust and support. Together we can make a real difference, and when companies order more than one unit, the numbers (in terms of savings) quickly add up. Revive and its clients are Partners in Sustainability,” said Liam.Since it began, Revive has formed many partnerships that have remained reliable and trustworthy. Acumec UK act as Revive’s UK distributors and proactively work hard to promote, demonstrate and create awareness in the industry of Revive’s products. Always evolving and continuously looking to broaden its markets, Liam explained the company’s recent successes: “In such a short space of time we have already gained the trust of some established and well-respected clients in the UK and Ireland and have just added a new partner that will be launching soon in Auckland, New Zealand. We have delivered trucks to Eastern Europe and will continue to grow and expand to ensure that the savings we provide are deliverable on a larger scale. Revive was formed during a global lockdown, so we are excited about what the future will bring once restrictions have eased.”As a company, Revive is relatively new to the industry, but has made a large impact already. Despite launching in the midst of COVID-19, Revive has had to tackle all challenges head on and has used specific restrictions to its advantage. “COVID-19 has been challenging for everyone, but we have managed to find positives within the restrictions. We are keen to minimise unnecessary business travel and mobile salespeople and have specifically chosen to utilise social media as much as possible. This approach has been positive for us and allows us to reach a wider audience without overly impacting our carbon footprint,” stated Liam.In closing, we asked Liam how he felt the company’s immediate impact to the industry has affected the overall outlook of sustainable business practices. “We are pleased with the steps we have made thus far and hope that the wider acknowledgement on a more sustainable future will only help us to grow and develop. We are confident in the quality of our products and believe that our customers will quickly see the financial and environmental benefits of our units.”For more information, see below.T (+353) 504 22422info@rei-limited.comwww.rei-limited.com",

          "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Sustainability Today, we are delighted to announce that we have chosen to present our Industry Excellence Award to Impact Air Systems for its outstanding efforts in sustainability, quality and performance of its air-based waste extraction and material separation solutions.“Our parent company has a strong corporate objective to support sustainability, so being recognised for this award, displays our work in accordance with this. At the core of our business, we support our customers by developing robust solutions to help minimise their environmental impact and increase the volume of materials being recycled. We also work extremely hard to ensure our own operations are environmentally friendly, so to accept an award that fully supports our overall business model is something we are extremely proud of,” stated Dave Lansdell, Impact’s Technical Sales Director.Impact Air Systems is based in Leicester and was established in 1989. Since it began, the company has developed a vast range of solutions and is now an internationally recognised company, completing projects on almost every continent and offers a total solution that reflects engineering at its best. With a passionate and dedicated team of staff, Impact has continued to develop the business and achieve year on year growth.As an industry leading air technology specialist with over 30 years’ experience in providing air systems around the world, Impact’s mission is to continue developing innovative solutions that affirms its position at the forefront of its industry, providing customers with solutions that meet their specific requirements as well as enable them to recycle more and work towards a zero-waste target.“We specialise in air-based material conveying and material separation solutions. We categorise the business into three main areas, waste and trim extraction and material separation systems, that can be applied to many industry sectors. In 2008, we diversified slightly to a much broader recycling industry and reapplied our own technology to separate materials based on density, size, and shape to support the increased expansion of household and curb side collections, and for this, we work with a lot of major UK and overseas recycling facilities. Thirdly, our environmental solutions enable us to offer dust and fume and odour control systems for those sectors,” said Dave.There are numerous industries to which Impact Air Systems provide solutions for, including recycling and industrial production facilities for printing, corrugated and carton board, foil and film, and beverage can. But what makes Impact Air Systems so significant to the industry, is its long-term established relationships. “Many of our clients have worked with us for decades. We have an impressive range of air-based solutions, and our team has exceptional knowledge of these as well as our clients’ processes, which we believe, is why a large percentage of our business comes from repeat custom. Our solutions provide outstanding results, and that is why our clients choose us again and again. We are always looking for ways to add value to a process through the application of our solutions,” said Dave.Impact Air Systems waste and trim removal systems are designed and installed to remove waste and off cuts from the manufacturing process of paper, carton board, foil, and film trim, can scrap, tissue and sticky label web. From full turnkey trim extraction systems to standalone extraction units, industries such as print, packaging, label and beverage can, will find everything needed to resolve all waste and trim extraction problems. Experience gained from serving a vast array of industrial sectors, means technology designed for one sector can often be applied to a completely different application.“We witnessed a significant increase in demand for our solutions and services from the packaging sector during the early parts of COVID-19 due to an increase in online shopping and ecommerce trading. Production output increased for large, corrugated and carton board packaging companies such as Smurfit Kappa. The beverage can sector also exploded, which was positive for us as we have a large presence in this sector providing various solutions to many of the big-name manufacturers such as Ball Packaging.  With thirty years of trading under our belt, we have a vast range of experience and knowledge of a broad range of industries from printing and packaging manufacture through to automotive, we cover it all.” stated Dave.Impact Air Systems also provide operation enhancing solutions for large ecommerce and fulfilment giants and major supermarket distribution centres, where the increase of online shopping has seen them struggle to handle unwanted flexible materials such as plastic film, cling pallet wrap, bags, and other flexible materials. “We offer solutions to these facilities to help them manage the huge volume of waste packaging and other flexible materials that come from deliveries and returned items. Our focus is to support these facilities with pneumatic conveying solutions, collecting waste materials from numerous positions within the facility and conveying them to one central recycling area, improving their overall ability to recycle those items” commented Dave.The result? No more bins, slip hazards or waste cages and a higher sorting efficiency, meaning the standard of recycling is vastly improved at source, resulting in a greater reduction in handling and transportation costs and treatment fees at the waste sites.Twelve months ago, Impact Air Systems re-engineered its popular density separation solution, the Zigzag Air Classifier (ZAC) due to increasing demands from clients who requested a higher throughput version. Combining its highly skilled in-house engineering team, 3D modelling software and working in conjunction with its carefully selected external supplier base, the ZAC1200 includes all the same features as smaller models but operates at a 50% higher capacity. The ZAC1200 handles up to 36m³/h and has been re-engineered for the separation of waste material such as glass, SRF and aggregates. The machine offers a fast return on investment, small footprint, and innovative engineering with one customer commenting on the system, “We process around 75,000 tons of construction and demolition waste a year and with the ZAC800 we can process the sub 40mm fraction and very effectively achieve a mix of clean glass, stone and ceramic that can be used in our recycled aggregate facility. Investing in Impact’s ZAC800 was an easy decision for us, Impact carried out a detailed trial on our material and the results that were promised, have now come to fruition. It can process waste streams at a high hourly throughput with material recovery results that are very impressive. The value in the cleaned glass and stone stream and Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) stream paid for the machine within the first 6 months of operation. The payback on this system has been so good, we’ve ordered another one!”Impact Air Systems also has a strong presence in the US, as well as Europe and Japan.Dave concluded with overseas plans for Impact, “Going forward, we wish to expand our presence and focus on the US, where we have been trading for over eight years now. We have strong partnerships across the waste management/materials recovery sector and with packaging manufacturers alike, so we plan to explore these areas further. With the global aim of reusing and recycling more, and with sustainability in mind, we are excited for the future of Impact’s success.”For more information, see below.T +44 (0)116 244 8855sales@impactairsystems.comwww.impactairsystems.com",

It is deeply concerning that these non-biodegradable\nmaterials that are literally present everywhere are entering and\naccumulating in our bodies,” Fawzy said.The researchers noted their findings, published in the journal\nEnvironmental Science & Technology, did not conclusively show that\nmicroplastics were causing IBD and said more research was needed to\ncorroborate and develop an explanation for the link.Nonetheless, the researchers said their study provided “evidence indicating\nthat a positive correlation exists between the concentration of fecal MPs\nand the severity of IBD”.The study, carried out by Zehua Yan, Yafei Liu, Ting Zhang, Faming Zhang,\nHongqiang Ren, and Yan Zhang at Nanjing Medical University, involved\nanalysing the faecal samples of 102 people, 52 with IBD and a further 50\nwho were healthy. According to the health information site Medical News\nToday, participants were also asked to detail the food and drinks they\nconsumed, their working and living conditions, demographic situation, and\nthe status of their IBD.The study revealed that those with IBD had considerably more microplastics\nin their poo than the healthy participants.The team noted that those who tended to drink more bottled water or ate\nmore takeaway food had the most microplastic particles in their stool.“We conclude that the plastic packaging of drinking water and food and dust\nexposure are important sources of human exposure to MPs,” the researchers\nwrote in their study's abstract.“The overwhelming evidence is that microplastics are in the water we drink,\nthe food we eat, and the air we breathe, so it’s inevitable we are finding\nthe particles in our bodies, which is why we have put ending the need for\nsingle-use bottles at the heart of our business mission as an international\nwater company,” said Bluewater founder, CEO, and environmental entrepreneur\nBengt Rittri. “The problem is that we still don’t know what damage the\nchemicals in the microplastic are doing to our health and wellbeing.”For more information, please contact Dave Noble, head of PR and\nCommunications Director, at david.noble@bluewatergroup.com or on his cell\nat +44 (0)7785 302694.\n",

A\nfight against floods, pollution and the unnecessary build-up of fat in our\nsewer network has reinforced the need to regularly inspect and maintain the\nnetwork, which in most cases is now over 100 years old.Tens of millions of pounds are spent each year on surprisingly advanced and\nregulated methods of inspection and renovation to maintain our networks.\nEmploying ‘No Dig Technology’, a means of inspection and repair without\nexcavating the pipes, helps significantly in keeping these costs down,\nspreading the budget across a wider area, satisfying the fifty year life\nexpectancy for customer's peace of mind. Sharing and analysis of inspection\ndata from a CCTV inspection survey, enables contractors to identify and\npinpoint an issue to conduct permanent localised repairs at reduced cost.\nWhether for pre-adoption (house purchase in domestic terms), or reactive\npurposes (repeat blockages, or subsidence investigation) these methods are\nwidely used in the UK and across the world.Viewline CCTV Inspection reports embrace this joined up approach and have\nbeen widely adopted by insurance claim handlers and contractors up and down\nthe country for this purpose. The reports intricately inform those carrying\nout repairs (and customers alike), of what needs to be done to keep the\ndrain in good serviceable condition. The technology is available at a\ndomestic level with reports including photographs and in depth\ndescriptions, making inspection the first invaluable step towards utilising\nNo Dig systems and helps tremendously in decisions which could save you\nhundreds of pounds.T 01752 358142\nenquiries@viewline.tv\nwww.viewline.tv\n",

          "DetailDescription": "With the increasing popularity of digital streaming and the advent of Cloud\nstorage, media devices such as VHS tapes, cassettes, CDs and even DVDs are\nbecoming things of the past. This has left many wondering how to dispose of\ntheir old tape and film, and where that old Buffy the Vampire Slayer boxset\nwould have ended up.TipTop Media Management Ltd now offers an environmentally friendly solution\nto VHS recycling, using Energy From Waste (EFW) technology to utilise the\nmedia of the past to fuel the present.Can I throw my old VHS tapes away?\nContrary to popular belief, VHS tapes and cassettes are unsuitable for\nlandfills, and cannot be collected as standard plastic recycling either.\nWhilst the outer casing of a video or tape is generally made from\npolypropylene plastic and can be recycled, the tape inside poses a problem.The plastic film inside your old E.T VHS or that once loved Prince cassette\nis coated in a variety of different metals. Referred to as Mylar, when left\nin a landfill it releases harmful toxins that are damaging to the\nenvironment, while the plastic itself can take thousands of years to\ndecompose.As a result, you cannot simply throw tapes and film into the trash. Whilst\ndonating your old media to charity shops is still an option, it is\nincreasingly unlikely that VHS tapes and cassettes will be accepted as\ndemand wanes and the popularity of playback devices decreases.But that doesn't mean that they have to remain collecting dust on your\nliving room shelf.#Saynotolandfill with TipTop Media Management\nAs concerns about waste disposal, landfills and our environmental impact\nincrease, it has become more important than ever to play our role in saving\nthe planet.At TipTop Media Management, developing an eco-friendly alternative to\nleaving old tape/film media to landfills has been a priority. A company\nspokesperson stated, “Our tape and film recycling programme aims to provide\naccessible and fast disposal of old media, acting as a sustainable solution\nthat produces power to feedback into the grid.”With the option of on-site media recycling bins available for businesses,\nas well as pick-ups available for individuals, TipTop Media Management has\nmade it easier than ever to dispose of your old media. They even guarantee\nthe safe and legal erasure of any data stored on collected devices -\nproviding peace of mind to those companies who previously stored data on\nphysical media devices.To find out more about TipTop Media Management Ltd's tape and film\nrecycling programme, visit: www.tiptopmedia.co.uk/recycling/#taperecycling\ntoday or go to: https://youtu.be/vswTjxNzZew\n",

          "DetailDescription": "This particular project involved creating a covered bunker onto an existing\nslab with many different levels, push walls up to 7m high and a cover over\nthe whole bunker. Not wanting to break through this concrete and create\nmore issues in terms of contaminated soils, muck away, underground\nservices, the solution was an in-situ plinth with concrete blocks on top,\nwhich RSG have used many times.\n\nRSG Managing Director, Gareth Neale, takes up the story. “As the existing\nslab was good, it would have been foolish not to use it, but varying levels\nmeant putting precast walls directly onto it would be an issue. Using a\nvarying height plinth acts in two ways, spreading the load of the walls\nabove and also levelling up any change in levels so the walls sit straight\nand true, this particular plinth was 0.4m at its shallowest and just over\n1.2m at its highest.\n\n“When we looked at the walls, there aren’t too many options available at\nthis sort of height, L walls or horizontal panels are a possibility but the\nfoot on an L wall at this height is around 2.6m which increases the\nfootprint dramatically and panels would require either stub stanchions or a\nheavy duty steel frame with correspondingly large foundations.Options for\nthe division walls are also very limited at this height and wouldn’t be\noperator friendly with feet or steelwork in the way.\n\n“This is where Elite Precast’s high strength Legato block comes into its\nown. When designed and installed correctly they can form very large walls\nto take large loads, including roof canopies on top. The use of double\nthickness walls at the base allows the walls to take the load of the stored\nproduct as well as the impact loading of operating machinery with ease.\nWith the division walls, a ‘footblock’ is used which creates a very neat\nself-cleaning detail.\n\n“The cover for all of this was formed using a steel monopitch frame which\nis founded to ground externally and to the top of the walls internally and\nincludes a spill flashing at the top of the wall to stop material leaking\nover. \n\n“Using this combination of products enables fast and efficient build time\nand huge versatility as the concrete plinth is the only part of this bunker\ncomplex that can’t be unbolted and taken away to be reconstructed on\nanother site.”\n\nAlongside their other services, RSG Structures are also pleased to announce\nthe launching of an industry first inspection service called SiteSafe.\n\nWhere clients have existing walls (constructed from interlocking blocks,\ntimber sleepers, L shapes, panels or anything else) they can organise a\nSiteSafe report which includes a site survey to observe current wall\nlayouts, systems, the types, designs and how walls are being used. The\nclient then receives a factual report which will note where systems in\nplace are working within design capability, highlight any areas of concern\nand recommend remedial actions to make the site safe, this is then signed\noff by an RSG Director and Structural Engineer.\n\nFor more information about the wide range of services offered by RSG\nStructures (including the new SiteSafe service), please contact:\ngneale@rsgstructures.co.uk or call Gareth on 08452 997597.\nFor more information on any of the products offered by Elite Precast,\nplease contact: sales@eliteprecast.co.uk or call 01952 588885.\n",

          "DetailDescription": "When vandals damaged the CHP control panels at EDL’s Wellingborough\nlandfill site, rendering the engines unusable, the timing could not have\nbeen worse. One week before Easter 2020, the coronavirus pandemic was\nsweeping the UK and the country had just been placed into an unprecedented\nnationwide lockdown. Site managers anticipated a significant period of\ndowntime but thanks to a swift response from gas engine support specialist\nGen-C, the upgraded engines were back up and running within just two weeks\nand are now performing better than ever.\n\nBased in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, the EDL landfill gas site\ngenerates 1.5 MW of power per hour, enough for 1,500 homes. It is a crucial\npower distribution site for the local area, so site engineers were dismayed\nto discover that vandals had broken in over the weekend before Easter and\nsmashed the CHP control panels, placing the engines out of action.\n\nPandemic pressure\n“At the time, the country was in a state of national emergency, with the\ncoronavirus lockdown having only just come into force,” says Paul Newman of\nNewman Electrical Services, main mechanical contractor for EDL Midlands.\n\nEven in normal times, getting the two Jenbacher 320 1 MW engines back up\nand running would have been a challenge as the damaged control systems were\nno longer available on the market, so fixing or replacing them was not\npossible. However, the added factor of a global pandemic affecting the\nsupply chain and resulting in millions of workers being furloughed made the\nsituation even trickier.\n\nDespite these concerns, Lee Heath, EDL’s Operations Manager, called Gen-C’s\nManaging Director James Thompson at 10am on the day the damage was\ndiscovered to see whether there was anything he could do. “I had dealt with\nGen-C for a number of years and had always been impressed by their level of\ncustomer service,” states Lee. “However, the speed of their response on\nthis occasion was astounding. Sean Kennedy, Gen-C’s Head of Sales, was on\nsite by 1pm to assess the damage and had quoted to replace the panels by\nthe end of the working day.”\n\nJames explains, “We could see the predicament that EDL were facing and knew\nhow important it was to get their engines back up and running as quickly as\npossible. As power supply specialists, we are classed as key workers, so we\nwere able to get on site within hours to assess the situation. We\nrecommended upgrading their vandalised panels to the far superior Motortech\nopen access control panels, which are based on the popular ComAp\ntechnology, along with Motortech ignition and knocking control systems.\nHowever, as this was an unplanned upgrade, it was especially important to\nkeep costs down, so we made sure the new equipment could interface with the\nengines’ existing Jenbacher parts, including the mixer, throttle and\nauxiliary components.”\n\nEstablishing social distance\nHappy with Gen-C’s quote, and the speed of response, EDL instructed them to\nbegin work as soon as possible. But with lockdown measures and social\ndistancing guidelines now imposed, this was to be an installation unlike\nany other. “In a week when most of our competitors were closing premises\nand furloughing staff, we were figuring out how to complete the project\nwhile minimising the chance of our employees, and EDL’s, catching COVID-\n19,” says James. “Firstly, with hotels being closed, I rented an oversized\nhouse in the local area for our engineers to stay in. It was big enough to\nzone off separate bedroom, living and bathroom areas for each person in\norder to minimise social interaction. I then assessed the site and\nidentified clear working zones for each staff member, to reduce the risk of\nexposure.”\n\nWith the health and safety of personnel now assured, it was also important\nto ensure that the supply chain had not been affected by the pandemic.\n“Fortunately, we have the capacity to store a lot of parts at our Sheffield\nheadquarters and every item required for the EDL project was in stock. This\nmeant we could begin work asap – in fact, we started the project just three\ndays after I received the initial call from Lee.”\n\nSuperior engine performance\nThe installation took place without a hitch – the first engine upgrade was\ncompleted within two weeks, despite the Easter bank holiday weekend and\nrestrictive COVID-19 working conditions, while the second took just eight\ndays. Gen-C’s engineers removed the vandalised control panels and replaced\nthem with Motortech’s advanced gas engine technology. Not only does this\nensure improved reliability for the engines, it also enables site managers\nto dial in remotely at any time via phone or tablet to see instantly how\nthe engines are performing, receive an alert whenever there is a fault,\ndiagnose the fault, rectify it and even remotely restart the engines. Gen-C\nalso upgraded the engines’ ignition and knocking control systems with the\nlatest Motortech technology.\n\n“The difference in performance is like night and day,” confirms Paul\nNewman. “The engines run much more smoothly and reliably, and the fact that\nwe can monitor and restart them remotely has proved invaluable; especially\nas fewer personnel have been able to be on site in recent months.”\n\nWith both engines running well, Paul and Lee are full of praise for Gen-C’s\nsupport during a difficult and unprecedented time: “Gen-C’s speed of\nresponse was fantastic, but more than that, their professionalism and\nknowledge ensured a difficult situation had a positive outcome for us.\nTheir ability to keep costs down was also impressive. Gen-C quoted us a\nfigure on the day we contacted them and stuck to that price throughout the\nproject; even when unexpected parts needed to be fitted. There were no\nsurprises for us in either cost, performance or service. Gen-C delivered\nexactly what they promised, on time and on budget.”\n\nContact: James Thompson, Managing Director\nT +44 (0)1709 718000\njames.thompson@gen-c.co.uk\nwww.gen-c.co.uk\n",

A wastewater treatment plant expansion has also been planned; however, unforeseen events have caused a 4-month delay in its construction. Without the ability to treat the effluents, the new production line cannot be operated, which represents a loss of € 200,000 per week for the company. Rather than accepting the delay, the company chose to turn to a water engineering company to find a solution.\n \nIn addition to blowers, Aerzen Rental Solutions can offer fine bubble air diffusion grids from within its portfolio, which can transform any tank into an aerobic treatment unit. Our water engineering customers, who have already used this capability in the past, naturally turned to us to install a temporary treatment solution in an existing sludge storage tank that was onsite.\n \nFor this process, it was decided to operate according to the principle of SBR (sequencing batch reactor), and this required the following equipment and operations:\n• A generator was required to provide power to the pumps and blower\n• Pumps and pipes to transfer process effluents to a buffer tank\n• Pumps for transferring homogeneous effluents into the mud silo\n• A 1500m3/h blower and 3 grids of fine bubble aeration diffusers\n• Seeding of the basin with sludge that requires delivery with slurry trucks.\n \nThe implementation of this temporary treatment project faced several safety and logistical challenges that were identified and mitigated by thoughtful planning and the technical expertise by the Aerzen Rental Solutions team. The busy construction site required stabilisation as the soft ground would not support the heavy equipment required (generators, blowers) With scheduled deliveries and a crane supporting the lifting and placement of the aeration grids into the sludge tanks. All the heavy equipment and accessories were connected and tested by Aerzen service engineers. The final biological treatment mass had to be sown, this was accomplished by using multiple deliveries of agricultural slurry. \n \nAerzen Rental Solutions where therefore able to offer a complete package solution to the customer in a quick and cost-effective time that mitigated the issue and the impending costs successfully\n\nM +44 (0)7903 645925\nDebbie.mayes@aerzenrental.com\nwww.aerzenrental.com",

          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is proud to announce Enertechnos as our Sustainable Energy Company of the Month. \n\nWith pressure mounting on energy companies to adopt more sustainable methods in producing, transmitting and distributing power, and industry and political leaders left facing the harsh consequences of years of careless practice, now more than ever it is vital that the energy sector is innovative and forward thinking in the way it approaches these challenges. To power our homes, businesses, and increasingly our transport, electrical energy must be transmitted and distributed from the point of generation to the point of use. This is not news. However, the current cabling infrastructure is no longer fit for purpose. \n\nThe current distribution network is not only outdated, but is causing harm, as the cabling we use to move electricity is leading to an avoidable loss of energy. The amount of energy available for consumption is significantly less than that which is generated. This loss then drives significant over- generation to compensate for the energy lost, and accounts for 1.5% of CO₂ emissions in the UK alone. The problem is that with attention being focused largely on more obvious environmentally harmful factors (such as cars, aviation, and heating systems), losses in transmission and distribution tend to go dangerously unnoticed.\n\nHaving identified this problem, Dominic Quennell and business partner Gareth O’Brien saw that a solution was waiting to be found. Five years and a lot of hard work later, Enertechnos is truly changing the way we think about cable infrastructure. With the development of its Capacitive Transfer System (CTS), Enertechnos is challenging the traditional cable industry with a greener, more efficient solution.  Using a CTS-enabled cable can deliver up to 70% more electrical energy than is possible with a conventional cable. This means less energy must be generated to service the same amount of demand than if traditional cable was used. \n\nOver the last 12 months, Enertechnos has signed its first licence agreement with Italian electrical company Tratos, as well as receiving a signed letter of intent from Western Power Distribution, the largest of the UK’s 14 distribution network operators. Excitingly, next year will see the cable installed for a real-world trial within Western Power’s network. Building working relationships with companies as reputable and as sizeable as these is no mean feat and stands as a testament to the innovation which is seeing Enertechnos capitalise on a gap in the market and bring about positive industrial change.\n\nCompanies like Enertechnos are the future. It is imperative that we are more than simply mindful of the impact we are having on the planet as we try and make life more comfortable for ourselves. Despite the welcome media attention on big corporations and governments, more ‘silent’ or ‘hidden’ emitters such as energy losses continue unnoticed, and therefore unsolved. Enertechnos, with its innovative CTS and forward-thinking attitude, will continue to be a key figure in drawing attention to, and solving these issues.\n\nFor more information on Enertechnos see the details listed below.\n\nT 0203 8656 381\nwww.enertechnos.com ",

          "DetailDescription": "Removing metal from virgin and recycled plastics is the focus on the Bunting Magnetic stand (Hall 10/J 47) at the international K 2019 exhibition (16-23 October 2019, Düsseldorf, Germany).\nBunting is one of the world’s leading designers and manufacturers of magnetic separators and metal detectors for the recycling and plastics industries.  The Bunting European manufacturing facilities for their wide range of metal separation and detection equipment are in Redditch, just outside Birmingham, and Berkhamsted, both in the United Kingdom. \n \nFigure 1 - Fine iron captured on the Tube Magnet of a FF Drawer Filter Magnet\nMetal contamination is an issue for any company producing plastics products or managing plastic waste.  In virgin plastic manufacturing processes, metal damages processing equipment and the quality of the end-product.  Recycled plastic commonly has both ferrous and non-ferrous metal contamination, and removal is vital to enable the reuse of the waste material.\nBunting will have application experts from the UK, Italy, and the USA at the stand to help with product application questions.  The Bunting product portfolio includes a wide range of magnetic separators and metal detectors to detect and remove any metal.\nThe FF and HF Drawer Filter Magnets are the most commonly used magnetic separators in the plastics sector.  Visitors will see both standard and manual-clean (MSC) designs, all utilising the highest strength Neodymium Iron Boron (Rare Earth) Magnets.  In operation, plastic beads or shredded plastic waste falls through the Drawer Filter under gravity with ferrous metal contamination attracted and held onto the surface of the strong magnets.\nAlso, on display in Europe for the first time, is the new Hi-Temp Drawer Filter Magnet Model FF350.  The FF350 Model enables processing material at the higher temperatures experienced when mounted directly to the inlet of injection moulding machines.  High heat is damaging to standard rare earth magnets and the new design maintains magnetic strength at temperatures up to 350°F (175°C).  There are also changes to the housing, window and access fixings to provide trouble free operation at the higher temperatures. \nRemoving ferrous metal contamination prior to passing through a metal detector significantly limits the loss of uncontaminated plastic.  The gravity free-fall style metal separator identifies and separates non-ferrous metal contamination.  Demonstrations on the stand will show the detection and rejection of small non-ferrous metal by the quickTRON 03R and Machine Mounted All-Metal (MMS) detectors.\nVisitors will also see displayed examples of the Pneumatic In-Line Magnet (PIM) and Torpedo In-Line Magnet (TIM), used to remove ferrous metal from pneumatically conveyed plastics.  These magnetic separators operate alongside the Pneumatic Style Metal Detector p-TRON 03 FM.  Pneumatic Style Metal Separators are designed to pick up (detect) and then reject any kind of metal from an enclosed pipe system.\nThe product display on the Bunting stand also includes the Plate Magnet (with and without tapered step) and Grate Magnets (round and square).\n \nFigure 2 - Contamination removed from secondary plastic\nThe issue of plastic waste continues to feature prominently in industry news and is a key discussion topic at K 2019.  Many plastic waste recycling operations use a combination of the Eddy Current Separator and Stainless Steel Separation Conveyor to cleanse the material of non-ferrous metals (e.g. aluminium) and fragmented stainless steel.  The Bunting Technical Team is available on the stand to discuss the best methods of cleansing plastic waste.  Controlled material tests at the Technical Laboratory in the UK confirm the level of separation and operating parameters.\n“Bunting’s experience in solving metal contamination issues in the plastics sector is second to none,” said Simon Ayling, Bunting Europe’s Managing Director.  “Separation technology used in the manufacture of virgin materials has been adapted and developed for the rapidly growing recycling sector.  Without removing metal from waste, the recycling of plastic is simply not possible.  At the K 2019 show, we look forward to meeting companies in the plastics sector and helping them address and solve their metal contamination problems.”\nFor further information, please contact us on press@buntingeurope.com or visit our websites www.buntingeurope.com and www.mastermagnets.com \nHigh resolution JPGs of all the images provided with this press release are available from the Bunting Press Officer, Paul Fears.

          "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Business and Industry Today, we have selected FuturEnergy as our Renewable Energy Company of the Month.\nEstablished in 2005 by Managing Director Peter Osborne, FuturEnergy has grown substantially since the company’s inception and has become a leading UK manufacturer and designer in the small wind turbine and Waste to Energy Sector.  Based at Ettington Park Business Centre near Stratford-Upon-Avon, the company provides various renewable products and services including contract Research and Development, production engineering, system integration and design for certification.\nSpeaking with Sales Manager, Sandra Shirley about what sets FuturEnergy apart from its competitors, she told us that, 'FuturEnergy wind turbines are UK made using our bespoke highly efficient Permanent Magnet Generators. We offer outstanding customer service directly from our Stratford-Upon-Avon offices, so whatever part of the world our turbines have been shipped to our customers know they are supported before, during and after the turbine installation.' \nFuturEnergy’s Airforce1 Wind Turbine is suitable for applications such as battery storage, water or space heating and local off-grid.  A grid connected option is currently under development.\nFuturEnergy has maintained a dedicated relationship with its customers and after receiving requests for technology to control and assist the wind turbines, FuturEnergy responded and the company has launched its product Airforce Control.\nThe Airforce Control has been specifically designed to enable the user to remotely stop the Airforce 1kW Wind Turbine. The advantage of using the Airforce Control is the user’s ability to control and protect the wind turbine. 'Airforce Control provides protection for the wind turbine especially when they have been installed in remote locations.' Sandra continued, 'When charge parameters are met, or other controlled parameters are exceeded, the turbine is automatically stopped and restarted by the Airforce Control when conditions return within operational limits, or further battery charging is required.'\nThrough expert design engineering, FuturEnergy provides specialist components as well as its wind turbines, these include products such as tower kits, stop-switches, resistors, blade sets, immersion heaters and FuturEnergy’s bespoke Permanent Magnet Generators. The PMG’s used in the turbines have been wholly designed and manufactured in-house, driven in part by the world-wide lack of generators that are matched to the low-speed high-torque demands of direct drive turbines. A bespoke generator design service is available for situations where off-the-shelf products do not exist for specialist applications. \nFuturEnergy will once again be exhibiting at the Farming Innovation Show at the Birmingham NEC on 6th-7th November 2019, broadening their network and market presence.  They will be showcasing their renewable energy products to a selection of farmers and companies who are increasingly interested in diversifying into areas that require energy independence. \n\nMore recently FuturEnergy has diversified in to providing Research and Development services to the Waste to Energy sector. They are involved in the Pyrolysis of rubber into oil, gas and carbon. As well as providing engineering services to the European Bioenergy Research Institute for the Pyrolysis of organic materials.\n\nSpeaking once more with Sandra Shirley, about the future plans for FuturEnergy, she noted, 'We intend to expand our presence in the Waste to Energy sector by manufacturing and installing for our Research and Development customers.' \nFor more information or to view FuturEnergy’s efficient renewable energy products please see the details below. \nT 01789 450280 www.futurenergy.co.uk",

These systems however require space, capital investment, after sales service and management. There may also be logistical and/or practical issues in providing untreated bypasses for potable applications, particularly in commercial situations- albeit essential in conjunction with Laundry/Dishwashing Machines and/or steam generating/total evaporation processes.\n\nSelection from the numerous ‘conditioners’ can however be challenging and still remains contentious as a result of over enthusiastic sales claims, inappropriate applications or simply inferior technology and some are seriously expensive with microprocessors, programming, and commissioning requirements. Systems now available will have wide ranging and varying operating parameters comprising hydro magnetic, electromagnetic, permanent magnetic, ultra-sonic, electric field, Electrostatic, Electrolytic, catalytic and so on, some have even used radio waves. All are however designed to maintain ‘mineral suspension’ and most effective when the water is constantly flowing.\n\nIn the absence of any empirical evidence or definitive conclusions published by independent recognised bodies, British Gas conducted their own investigative product comparison evaluations several years ago, subsequently endorsed performance of the SUPRION and now installed over 70,000 units for protection of water heating appliances.\n\nFull technically illustrated details and selected applications are available on our website, drawing your attention to the numerous unique design features and long term operating benefits:\n- Environmentally friendly zero carbon footprint\n- Operator fool-proof with self-energising design\n- No power supply, magnets or coils\n- No micro-processors with potential BMS requirement\n- No commissioning required\n- Generally maintenance free with no filters or chemicals\n- No electrolysis evident with sacrificial electrode designs\n- Clear and open tube construction with no flow restriction or pressure drop.\n- Standard progressive range of sizes from 10 to 450mm diameter\n- EH prefix models specifically designed for electrically heated appliances\n- WRAS approved for drinking water applications\n- Five year manufacturer’s warranty - minimum ten years operation\n- British Gas endorsement on performance\n- Simple installation with either compression, screwed or flanged ends\n- No minimum linear length before/after elbows, tees etc\n- Vertical or horizontal orientation\n-Competitive pricing structure\n\nThere are numerous and more obvious wide ranging applications where water is heated and calcium precipitation occurs, but ICE-MAKERS have proved a particularly economic, practical and effective application since the internal areas provide the environmental conditions for bacteria to accumulate if not regularly maintained, de-scaled or appropriate treatment included to the feed water supply; artificially softened water should not be used as the sodium concentration is increased and non-compliant with PCV's (prescribed concentration levels) for potable supplies.\n\nStandard carbon filters will only remove dirt, rust, sediment taste and odour and the addition of polyphosphates will apply a film to internal waterways to inhibit scale formation, albeit not guaranteed.\n\nReverse Osmosis (RO) will certainly prove effective, but not generally practical unless available from a central plant and food grade resin based systems can prove extremely expensive to maintain a calcium free supply, especially in respect of single feed ‘self-flushing’ machines.\n\nThe SUPRION was first trialled in this context at The London Hilton back in 1990 on a common manifold supply several Banqueting Ice-Makers and resolved regular quarterly scale related issues, resulting in additional large units being incorporated during plant room refurbishments.\n\nIt was then adopted by one of the FOSTER REFRIGERATOR who are one of the UK’s most reputable and respected refrigeration equipment manufacturers and being fitted to IceMakers in major high street restaurant chains throughout the UK.",

          "DetailDescription": "Public Power Solutions (PPS) has been selected as our highly regarded Solar Project Provider of the Year, we are delighted to announce here at Business and Industry Today.\n\nThe company, which is wholly owned by Swindon Borough Council, focuses specifically on the provision of ethical end to end services relating to solar energy. Its aim is to facilitate the needs of both its clients and the resident communities they serve, and this is achieved by harnessing the resources available from the all-important public and commercial industry sectors.\n\nThe local authority‐owned company strives to assist customers that are hoping to save money whilst generating and using their own electricity. Organisations that have their own landfills, car parks, buildings and unused land can make the most of their property in an economic way by using solar to their advantage; creating new income streams and simultaneously helping the environment by significantly reducing their carbon footprint.\n\nFinancially, the power solutions available will enable organisations to remain protected from fluctuations in electricity prices (which are typically unstable and subject to frequent change), and because the building running costs will be noticeably reduced, owners can free their budget up for effective use in other areas.\n\nSteve Cains, Head of Power Solutions was keen to tell us more about the recent success of the company: “In the last 12 months as a result of government changes in solar subsidies, the company has changed its business model to focus on private wire projects rather than grid connected schemes,” he divulged. “In the past year there has also been significant change to our internal structures which has seen growth across both the waste and power business areas. Further recruitment is also planned for 2017.  \n\n“We posted a £700k profit for the last financial year in line with our forecast and are again in line with forecast for 16/17. There have been many highlights, such as the successful development and connection of a 61 MW solar development at Wroughton Science Museum and the first public sector and community investment to fund a 4.8 MW solar farm on council-owned land at Common Farm in Wroughton. Swindon Borough Council invested £3 million alongside £1.8 million raised from the public through the UK’s first council solar bond launched this spring through Abundance Investment. The offer was so successful, it closed a month early. In November we also launched a second solar bond offer, again through Abundance and eligible for the first green energy ISA, for Chapel Farm, a former landfill site near Blunsdon, which to date has raised over £2m.\n\n“We are currently in the process of developing a 2.5MW private wire scheme on a closed landfill site at Barnfield Road, with a private wire directly into the PPS Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) plant which processes Swindon Borough Council’s black bag waste and external waste to produce a solid recovered fuel which is used in place of fossil fuels. This plant currently diverts 97% of the Council’s black bag waste away from landfill and will be powered by the solar park by 31 March 2017. We are also working with SBC on a number of private wire car port schemes which will also be built and connected by March 2017.”\n\nPPS operates by means of a five-phase process which ensures the entire project goes smoothly, from the inception to the finalisation. The first step is feasibility: an informed company representative will be on hand to conduct a feasibility study – free of charge (unless a more detailed consultation is required; this will incur a small fee). This covers all of the technicalities of planning and grid connection whilst considering ownership aspirations, legal documents, internal rate of return, construction costs and financial obligations.\n\nThe second stage relates to development and centres predominantly on community involvement; arranging collective participation in upcoming schemes via pre-agreed mailings and scheduled events and putting in place all the required project rights for the scheme. The third, procurement, revolves around PPS’ Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS), which can be employed as appropriate for public sector bodies procuring solar projects in line with the necessary Public Contract Regulations 2015. This will be used to appoint funders, ICP’s, ECPs and O&M contracts. PPS is able to provide this service due to being classed as a contracting body due to the ownership structure.\n\nThe penultimate phase is construction and is concerned with the completion of the project and the associated liaisons between contractors and the customer. The final service is the required aftersales support; coordinating asset management activities (operations and maintenance) to ensure the solution is performing as efficiently as possible in its chosen location.\n\nAlthough this is a tried and tested method, PPS isn’t afraid to innovate for the purpose of accessing additional markets, as Steve told us: “We are now focusing on private wire initiatives primarily within the public sector (including councils, MOD, government departments) to increase their revenue streams through rent and business rates and to reduce energy costs. Our solutions are around bridging gaps in revenue for the local authority and bringing in new revenue streams for them from solar as well as meeting their green energy aspirations and targets.\n\n“We are looking at innovative energy solutions such as storage and grid demand response, as part of this, we are working with the Council to undertake a feasibility study on the potential for a waste to energy plant on site to use the SRF we have produced to power our plant. We are also looking at solutions for fines and heavies which are a bi-product of the plant and this will enable us to divert even more waste from landfill.\n\n“Overall we are really happy that the work we are doing is being recognised in this way (by Business and Industry Today). We are also pleased to have been provided with an opportunity to communicate our services and how we can help the local authorities and public sector.”\n\nAs an established impartial provider PPS has the knowledge, experience and capability to complete projects of varying sizes and levels of complexity. Its sustainable power and waste solutions have proven to meet carbon reduction targets and reduce landfill by up to 97%, and this has been vastly appreciated by the likes of Swindon Borough Council, The Science Museum Group, Gloucester County Council, Wiltshire Wildlife Trust and Bristol City Council. \n\nIts impressive track record is emphasised with its Swindon statistics: on a yearly basis, the team can install enough solar capacity to power 20,000 homes and divert 50,000 tonnes of household waste from landfill to fuel production. Become part of this exciting movement today – all you have to do is contact PPS to find out for yourself how you can maximise the energy and money saving potential of your land and buildings.",

With vertically integrated cover lens and touch panel\nmanufacturing, and a highly automated TFT facility, Yeebo is the natural\npartner for developing display solutions that push the limits of visual\ninterface design on aesthetic, performance and functionality.One component attracting growing interest in recent TFT designs is the\ncover lens. Not only does a well-crafted cover lens protect the screen from\nmechanical impact and weather conditions, but it also contributes to the\noverall visual appeal of the final product. Choosing the best cover lens no\nlonger stops at its basic features - material, shape and décor options. New\nrequirements demand that the TFT visible area is purely dark when the\nscreen is inactive, blending display and cover lens with no visual\ndistinction.Yeebo is at the forefront of cover lens designs with a technology developed\nby combining low-transflective glass and an engineered optical bonding\nadhesive. By controlling light transmittance within the stack, the cover\nlens system completely conceals the TFT when inactive, creating a\ndistinctive Piano Black look.With this unique feature, companies eager to differentiate the aesthetic of\ntheir products, whether it’s a smart health monitor, pro audio equipment or\nhome automation system, can now ensure they stand out from the competition.Contact Yeebo Display Europe today to discuss how to integrate Piano Black\nTFT displays into your next project:\nT +44 (0)203 287 6886\ninfo@yeeboeurope.com\nwww.yeeboeurope.com\n",

          "Description": "Business and Industry Today is proud to announce that Acoustic Camera UK Ltd has been selected as our Acoustic Technology Company of the Month",
          "DetailDescription": "You’ve heard of thermal imaging, where heat sources are shown as colour on\na live video feed?  Well now you can do the same with noise sources. So\ninstead of trying to guess which machines or parts of them are responsible\nfor elevated levels, you can look around and see them live on the screen,\nand of course, record them as you would a normal video or photograph. But\nthe real revolution is that this incredible tool is packaged like a video\ncamera, with a touch screen anyone can use. So it really is an essential\ntool that is revolutionising noise control.\n\nAlong with offering numerous features and high levels of accuracy, the\nSOUNDCAM is easy enough to use for those without acoustic expertise. Those\nworking in health and safety and general maintenance on site can now easily\nidentify sources of sound and address them as needed. “It is battery\npowered with a touchscreen making it highly portable, as well as being\ndurable and waterproof. It’s as easy to use as a mobile phone.”\n\nThe camera offers unbelievable quality, accuracy and portability using\nstate-of-the-art German technology. “The German company that makes these is\nthe world market leader in this area, but up until a year ago when I set up\nAcoustic Camera UK, there wasn’t a distributor here,” explained Richard\nO’Sullivan. “We can offer this market leading technology at extremely\ncompetitive prices, and it offers much better performance than others in\nthis specialist market.”\n\nThe SOUNDCAM is ideal for preventative maintenance for plant and machinery.\nIt can be programmed to detect if an unusual noise occurs, which triggers\nthe device and alerts you to a potential issue with the machine. This means\nthe equipment can be serviced before it shuts down completely, minimising\nthe risk of excessive downtime and its consequences on operations.\n\n“It’s also excellent for maintaining appropriate health and safety\nstandards in regards to sound levels. The traditional sound level meter is\nomni-directional and can only show that noise levels at the worker’s\nstation are high. It gives no information about the loud sources. The\nSOUNDCAM shows a colour map of the whole spectrum of audible sound, with\nthe highest levels being clearly highlighted. You can then bracket these\nfrequencies and the source shows up on the live camera picture as a flame\nof colour. Maybe a fan has become loud, or the seals on a noise enclosure\nare leaking – these would show as yellow flames overlaid on the live video\npicture, which you can also save as screenshots or full videos.  So you can\ninstantly discover the loud noise sources, and then address them to reduce\nworker’s noise exposure.”\n\nAs well as protecting workers and preventing potential downtime costs, the\nSOUNDCAM can also help you make significant energy savings. Often, a\nfactory’s complicated network of compressed air lines is difficult to\naccess for repair work. As the network leaks over time, another compressor\nis put in to compensate for the air that’s leaking into the atmosphere,\nresulting in a huge energy loss, something which is even more significant\nwith the push for a ‘Green Recovery’ post-COVID. With the SOUNDCAM, you can\neasily detect the hissing noise of the leaks and discover exactly which\njoint is leaking, even with high factory noise. Losses due to arcing and\nsparking can also be found easily with the SOUNDCAM. This means maintenance\npersonnel can find and fix the issues quickly.\n“With the savings made from preventative maintenance and energy costs, the\nSOUNDCAM very quickly pays for itself. Some companies are saving thousands\nevery month thanks to the device,” Richard elaborated.\n\nWe have city council environmental noise control experts using the SOUNDCAM\nto locate and document noise sources. They are often able to advise on\nsimple solutions, say for example if the SOUNDCAM shows the factory noise\nleaking out of worn or ill fitting door or window seals. We have also had\nenquiries about using the SOUNDCAM like a speeding camera to record noisy\nvehicles.  As well as other more obvious applications like product noise\noptimisation, we have a long list of other users, for example wildlife\ncamera teams and bird watchers.  The ability to instantly see sound sources\nis a really game-changing technology that our new SOUNDCAM has brought\nwithin the reach of a growing range of applications, due to its usability,\nportability and affordability.\n\nAlthough the device is easy to use, if you don’t feel comfortable using the\nequipment, Acoustic Camera UK also offers consulting services. “I’ve been\ndoing work with this technology for many years and can quickly identify\nnoise problems, as well as giving advise on how to solve them. I can come\nto your premises and use the equipment so you can quickly discover the\nnoise source and address it appropriately.” Furthermore, the SOUNDCAM can\nbe obtained on a rental basis, and then can be bought at a reduced price\nshould you decide to keep it.\n\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has brought numerous challenges this year,\nRichard is looking positively to towards the future. “It was going well\nlast year and at the beginning of this year, but then obviously things have\nstalled a bit once everyone shut down. As places start to open up again,\nI’m confident we’ll start getting more interest.”\n\nIndeed, the company has cleverly adapted to the ‘new normal’, and can now\noffer a free trial of the SOUNDCAM without the need to visit your location.\nAfter receiving a demo SOUNDCAM, at no cost except for the return carriage,\nAcoustic Camera UK will then do a video conference with you to explain how\nto use the device.\n\nIf you would like to find out more information on SOUNDCAM and Acoustic\nCamera UK’s full range of technology, head to the website. Here, you can\nalso find a range of videos of the SOUNDCAM in use and discover the\ndevice’s vast range of potential.

          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is delighted to announce as our Software Company of the Month, Merlinsoft Ltd. Merlin is reshaping the manner in which large and small venues are able to fully integrate all their operations, and maintain the mechanisms that contribute to the smooth running of their business. \n\nTotal venue management is imperative to the well-oiled running of any event or attraction, from front of house sales to back-office control and reporting.  Merlin ensures that those operating the venue have comprehensive and up to date information at their finger tips at all times.  This level of control is vital to ensure that those visiting the venue get the best out of their experience. The core of the Merlin solution is a fully integrated business management and reporting system that allows users to track the all the various details of any of the day-to-day venue operations quickly, easily and in real time, from any terminal.\n\nMerlin has over 35 years experience in developing retail management systems, and has seen wide and diverse changes in that time, some of which from its own design and development team. In 1995, the company launched the world’s first touch screen, wall mountable EPOS system, which subsequently went on to be adopted by Olivetti and was marketed as the Olitouch. During the last 20 years Merlin has improved dramatically on its software, notably pioneering the collection of Gift-Aid on admission charges at visitor attractions as far back as 2002. Merlin has since had its software installed in a variety of countries, most recently in Oman where it provides total venue management for the New National Museum.\n\nThe software solution includes an abundance of management and reporting tools, each tailored to the sector that the company using it exists within. For example, in 2008 Merlin was the first company to provide an EPOS system designed for use among charities and charity shops to allow for the collection of Gift Aid on donated goods.  The system was also the first to be audited and certified by HMRC and went on to win several awards.\n\nMerlin also has software that can be integrated seamlessly with venues where memberships are used or required. The software can track the visits and transactions of all members, and through EPOS can prompt renewals, which are then updated in the Merlin back office. This eliminates the potential for a membership venue to lose clients as a result of lack of membership renewal, which is a common cause for loss of business. \n\nThese are merely two examples of the sectors served by Merlin, others include multi-branch operation, bars and restaurants, theme parks, retail and wholesale, museum and heritage sites, railway tours and boat trips. However there is no venue that exists beyond the reach of Merlin’s aid. \n\nMerlin has also developed an online ticketing platform, through which users can create their own ticketing website so that tickets can be purchased 24/7.  The system also allows for a wide range of design layouts for a user to choose from, allowing them to keep all their own branding \n\nMerlin has recently introduced a new seated arenas module, wherein the orchestration of larger events can be managed, also offering the user the option of choosing their own design layout, thus easing the management experience. The company plans on introducing further modules in the foreseeable future, and delivering to a broader range of clients and sectors.

This new 1.6 acre site has a large open plan office, a repair centre and a modern high bay warehouse with a narrow-aisle layout increasing stock holding efficiency, plus multiple delivery and dispatch bays.\n\nAndrew Jeffrey started as a mobile DJ when he was just 14, before going on to work in a DJ retail store where he was promoted to Manager at 19. Two years later, he bought the company outright and started looking for alternative products overseas, which led him to develop an extensive knowledge of the European lighting market. Leading to a huge gr¬owth in retail sales, the company became one of the largest and most respected DJ stores in the UK, and many other stores around the country had heard about new types of European effects and wanted to stock them, which inspired Andrew to set up a distribution company, and so The Prolight Concepts Group was created.\n\nDue to Andrew’s extensive knowledge, the company saw the development of further lighting and audio solutions, which opened up sales avenues in other sectors and gave the company a wider market share. Prolight not only provide luminaires, audio equipment, truss and accessories for the entertainment, professional installation, architectural and leisure markets in the UK, they also distribute internationally and are known throughout the world for their quality products and service. The team are dedicated to providing a full, efficient and ever-developing service, working closely with suppliers to offer their customers the highest build quality and affordability.\n\nWe asked the General Manager Bernie Marsh about their newest product developments: “One of our most recent additions is the 9RE Beam from our eLumen8 brand which is a moving head fixture with a revolutionary new 9R lamp. As we are constantly adding to our brand and product portfolio, we recommend lighting designers, installers, retailers and consumers alike keep an eye on our new items page of the website or follow on social media to keep up-to-date on what we have up our sleeves next.” \n\nThey also recently expanded their eLumen8 MP Fresnel range with the MP 120 WW, which boasts a 200mm lens and a 120W 3000K COB LED, producing a soft edge beam ideal for stage and theatrical lighting applications. They been heavily developing their exterior lighting too with new ranges being expanded and added including the Aspect Series and the new QB1 IP rated uplighters. Not forgetting their continued support of the mobile DJ industry with their Equinox brand, that recently saw the release of the Confetti Burst cannon. \n\nWith brands covering nearly all aspects of their industry, Prolight are fast proving they are the one-stop-shop for all lighting and sound products and accessories. Alongside their own brand umbrella, Prolight also have distribution rights to other established brands including Global Truss, and more recently acquired distribution of LDR, a northern Italy based company that has established itself as a major international supplier of theatrical and architectural spotlights, profiles, floodlights and followspots; Lynx Pro-Audio, a high-end, fast developing pro audio manufacturer based in Valencia, Spain with a mission to design the most advanced and innovative sound systems, and The Confetti Maker, a Netherlands based special effects company.\n\nIn the coming months, Prolight Concepts Group will be releasing a new 2019/20 catalogue, detailing the extensive selection of audio and lighting products they have on offer. In the long term, the company are looking to continue to expand their market share in the UK Europe and beyond.\n\nT 01254 704111\nwww.prolight.co.uk\n",

          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is pleased to feature Codesplice as our Information Technologies Solutions Company of the Month. Codesplice provide a wide range of unique IT solutions to all manner of businesses; there is no job too big or small, no project too specific.\n\nEstablished in 1996 by current Managing Director Hitesh Kothari, Codesplice have their headquarters in Middlesex with offices in London and in the Czech Republic, where a subsidiary handles the company’s European operations. Codesplice offer a truly diverse and comprehensive range of IT services, including: software development, mobile web solutions, cloud solutions, hosting, support services, infrastructure provision, architecture and design of systems, IT project management, and IT consulting. \n\nI spoke to Andrew de Bray of Codesplice in order to gain a deeper understanding of how Codesplice came to be, how they operate, what services they provide, and everything in between. “So, we are essentially an IT products and services company, which is actually a very broad sector, and which covers many activities. However, we have had particular success in 2 industries. Our FMVerify product has sold very well in the pharmaceuticals software supply chain industry, where it is used to monitor the movement of medicines and identify falsified medicines which have entered the supply chain illegally.”\n\nFMVerify is Codesplice’s flagship product, one which has proved successful for the business since its inception. FMVerify is a purpose built FMD (Falsified Medicines Directive), designed by professionals in the medical supply chain industry for pharmacies, pharmacy chains, wholesalers with one or more sites, hospital dispensaries and healthcare institutions. I asked Andrew how FMVerify came to be, “The company has always been involved in activity in and around the medicinal product supply chain and when the Falsified Medicines Directive was announced and came close to implementation, he saw an opportunity to expand into supply chain software. The current board of directors was appointed in 2018 and existing products and services were reviewed and amended to also be able to provide software to customers in the medicines supply chain.”\n\nFor the team at Codesplice, FMVerify is more than just a software product, it’s a safeguard against the very serious issue of falsified and therefore unsafe medicines infiltrating medicine supply chains, ultimately being administered to patients. “This is a growing area in terms of fraud and therefore there is a growing risk to patient healthcare also.” Andrew tells me. FMVerify ensures that falsified medicines are not only removed from the supply chain but takes steps to ensure they do not make it into the supply chain in the first place. \n\nWhat makes Codesplice stand out from the crowd is their commitment to remaining flexible in order to best suit the customer’s needs. “When we provide solutions”, Andrew explains, “we look at all the axis in which our solutions may be measured and make the product flexible, so that it can be made to suit a customer’s needs but still aim to price it fairly for the market and usages to which it will be applied.” The success of FMVerify, coupled with the exciting and innovative products currently in development by Codesplice renders the company’s future very bright indeed.\n\nT 0208 150 1148 \ncontact@fmverify.com\nwww.codesplice.com\n",

          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is extremely excited to announce that Workforce Scheduling Solutions has been awarded with our esteemed Specialist Software Company of the Month profile as a result of their highly efficient, simplistic and powerful work applications software. \n\nWorkforce Scheduling Solutions have over 20 years’ experience specialising in the development and support of time and attendance software, largely for use in a work environment. Based in the UK, Workforce operates on an international scale, with their software solutions in use among start-ups, SMEs and multi-national companies in many sectors the world over.  The company is headed by Roy Ferris, who explained how the team are able to help businesses maximise their workforce, increase efficiency and organise schedules.\n\nThe director explained, 'We offer both consultation services and workforce orientated software that helps to improve time and attendance management, facilitating organisation, eliminating paperwork and keeping the company in line with GDPR. There are two components to our software, the first being our touch screen display. When an employee first arrives at work, they simply enter their PIN into the display so they can be identified, and then a picture is taken of them. Our face recognition technology ensures it is really the employee in question clocking in. \n\n'Secondly, the software creates easy to digest time sheets which can be synchronised with the company’s schedules using the cloud. These time sheets display staff hours, pay roll information, when and where the employee should be for their shift, and much more.' \n\nThe workforce software can be applied in any business where there is shift work or hourly paid employees. The software has a powerful payroll engine and is highly adaptable, capable of accommodating a change in hours, and different pay rates for weekly, monthly or day and night shifts. In fact, the software is even flexible enough to handle temporary and agency staff, taking a photo of the employee in order to ensure security. \n\nWorkforce’s software is highly intuitive, and staff are able to reschedule their own shifts with the approval of senior staff at the push of a button. Not only that, but should an employee arrive for work early, the software will ensure they are not paid extra for that additional duration of time. There are a great many added features and benefits to the Workforce software, with Roy adding, 'One of the biggest concerns for employers is their night shift staff, who for productivity and safety reasons, need to be accounted for during the night. With our software, night staff must clock in every hour or other defined period, in order to show that they are awake, working and safe.'\n\nWorkforce continually innovates upon their existing software and release around 2 or 3 updates a year, and most recently they updated the software to expand its holiday capabilities. Using a new and easy interface portal, employees can view their shifts and remaining holiday whether at work, at home or even on their mobile. \n\nIf you are interested in finding out more about Workforce Scheduling Solutions’ exceptional services, then be sure to get in touch using the contact details below.

          "DetailDescription": "BEC have been leading the way in lead times on End-of-Life (EoL) or in-production alternatives in electronic components for 40 years now, and we were very lucky and excited to discuss BEC Distribution Ltd in greater detail with Dr. Farshid Degan, head of Business Development at BEC. \n\n“We have a huge range of passive electronic components available, sourced from some of the world’s leading manufacturers. This includes TOKO, ATE Resistors, Megaman, TEMWELL, Central Technologies, and Hellermanntyton, to name a few. In fact, we have one of the largest stocks of TOKO, PULS Power Supplies and Arcol Resistor components in the world.”\n\nIt is not only parts that BEC supply however, as they also have in depth product knowledge on all their wares. As such, they can work with clients to help them find the exact component they need, offer second source options and alternatives to standard components, replacements for discontinued items, and then provide information on stock availability, delivery, quotes, and volume pricing. Better yet, BEC can even offer custom value components. Effectively, they offer a One Stop Shop solution for everyone within the UK technical and manufacturing industry, such as Design Houses, Original Equipment Manufacturers, Contract Electronic Manufacturers, R&D, and even Academic establishments around the world. \n\nTheir components are used far and wide throughout different industries, such as Avionics, within Submarines, Aerospace, Rail, the Medical sector, and Communication Systems. \n\nOne of the reasons they have risen to the top of the distribution sector is their ability to guarantee short delivery lead times and much better pricing. Not only that, but they are constantly adding to their stock list, having recently been named an official franchise supplier for the likes of JB Capacitors. In addition, their stock list has increased to include a brand new mini range of High current and Low profile ceramic conductors. \n\nFarshid added, “As a company, we champion transparency, promptness and straightforwardness in everything we do. Our competitive advantage is based not on doing what others already do well, but on doing what others cannot do as well. Not only is this true for us now, but it has been the secret of BEC’s success over the past 40 years.”\n\nBEC have accrued a number of achievements in recent years, including having upgraded to ISO:9001-2015, meaning they can offer even better services and faster lead times. Moving into the future, they also have exciting plans to manufacture their own HV resistors for use in green energy applications. \n\nFarshid added, “We are extremely proud to announce that we have recently started to offer an End-of-Life components replacement service. This is incredibly game changing, as typically, manufacturers discontinue product lines after 5-10 years. Such cancellations can have disastrous impacts on customers whose products have longer expected lifetimes, such as for Aerospace, Medical, Surveillance or Defence industry equipment. \n\nManufacturers’ EoL announcements and their disastrous impacts on engineers and buyers has been a consistent and enduring theme of BEC’s supply experience. EoL announcements are spurred by everything from changes in raw materials or availability, to mergers & acquisitions. Soon after MURATA acquired TOKO, as an example, most of TOKO’s product lines went EoL. Due to such events, we have gone to great lengths to create our one of a kind replacement services, and give customers peace of mind.\n\n“Our EoL Component Sourcing Service has proven to be a lifeline to R&D engineers and buyers. With a stock of 15 million passive components, BEC can provide high quality, pin-for-pin direct replacement or alternatives. If the required components are not in stock, then BEC will track down and source matching alternatives, ensuring that EoL issues will not hinder customers’ projects.”\n\nBEC was first established in 1978 and is located in Buckingham, with various other locations in High Wycombe and Maidenhead. The components they distribute include inductors, filters, resistors, capacitors, batteries, fans, LEDs and even power supply units. \n\nIf you would like to find out more information about BEC Distribution, or to get in contact, with the team, be sure to give the team a call on the number below, or feel free to check out the website. \n\nT 0845 4900 405 \nwww.bec.co.uk\n",

          "DetailDescription": "Business and Industry Today is extremely proud to present a highly prestigious and richly deserved Commitment to Excellence profile to Revo Service Management, owing to its ongoing dedication to providing advanced solutions that have great value in a multitude of industries. \n\nSince its establishment in 2008, Revo has become a recognised name in the industry and is renowned for its innovative products, quality service and experienced staff. By cleverly combining people, processes and technology, the company has helped thousands of customers around the globe perfect their Information Technology Service Management (ITSM). \n\nLast year, the company went through a management buyout and changed its name from Infravision to Revo. The change brought with it many benefits for Revo customers as new and improved products and services were introduced and a new website was launched. \n\n“Last year especially was extremely successful for Revo,” commented Managing Director Simon Martin. “Even though we had a lot going on, we still went over our forecast by 20% and significantly raised our client base to serve more than 300 clients. This has been a great form of motivation for our team as we move on to new and exciting ventures.\n\n“At Revo, we continuously strive to offer the best for our customers. We are always innovating and keeping up to date with the latest and most cutting-edge technology available. Our tag line, ‘a partner like no other’ demonstrates our determination to not just sell products, but also to offer an in-depth service where we provide expert advice to ensure customers receive the right solution to suit their needs.”\n\nRevo is leading the movement for a change in the ITSM world and has introduced the new and revolutionary ITRP – an enterprise-class IT service management application built specifically for multinational organisations. \n\n“The ITSM world needs to change,” Simon explained. “There has been a lack of innovation for many years as vendors offer the same technology with more and more complex configurations, which all comes at a cost to the business customer. ITRP is reinventing the approach to service management and its delivery, focusing on improving business processes and the way in which organisations, departments and third parties communicate and share data. Don’t settle for another ‘me-too’ vendor, take a look at what makes ITRP different.”\n\nSetting itself apart from standard Enterprise ITSM, Service Management and SIAM systems, this advanced and innovative solution boasts a whole host of advantages. With its unbeatable productivity, users can achieve truly seamless collaboration between all the various service providers that deliver IT services to the business, increasing the productivity of the entire IT department by a substantial amount. ITRP is proven to significantly save time on non-value-added admin work by IT staff.\n \nITRP addresses a huge range of challenges with one single, intuitive solution that fits every business. By offering the ability to collaborate more efficiently, ITRP helps all parties to resolve incidents more quickly and to implement changes as soon as a business need has been identified. IT managers can finally receive complete information enabling them to stay in control of the IT services they procure as well as the ones they deliver.\n\nThe intelligent system also combines all the different applications into a central workload management interface, making everyone fully aware of how potential changes affect existing agreements and configurations. ITRP is built for speed and allows users instant access to information, meaning that customers can be served considerably faster by your service desk and that the performance of your entire support organisation can be improved.\n\nWhat makes ITRP superior to its competitors is Revo’s EaaS – the Everything as a Service Product Subscription. Unlike other service providers that sell products and services separately, Revo offers everything together at one fixed price. Once they have subscribed, customers receive full, inclusive implementation services so they no longer need to pay extra if their system has a fault or needs replacing. This fairly priced subscription service gives customers peace of mind that their products are fully supported and offers guaranteed reliability and longevity.\n\n“Our approach to business-driven ITSM leverages frameworks such as ITIL, CobiT and ISO/IEC20000 as part of a hands-on, real-world approach to ITSM. It has helped hundreds of companies transform their IT organisations into strategic, business-aligned service providers delivering the highest levels of service and support to their customers while lowering costs,” Simon explained.\n\n“We are so confident in our solutions that we don’t tie customers down with fixed contracts, meaning they can leave whenever they wish. We strive to offer a customer service that is second to none, because if we don’t provide a good service we will have no subscriptions. \n\n“We are extremely pleased to have been awarded the Company of the Year award and feel it is a testament to our hard work and dedication in the industry. The recognition drives us to continue to provide exceptional solutions while always staying dedicated to our promise of giving each and every customer an efficient and friendly service,” Simon concluded.\n\nIf you would like any more information on Revo’s services and products, then please don’t hesitate to get in touch today.

          "DetailDescription": "The extensively appreciated BMC, ITRP, Nexthink, RightAnswers and Bomgar partner was officially established in 2008 as the UK arm of InfraVision BV (Netherlands) and has since transformed to become a reputable Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) company. As of June 2016 InfraVision Limited became independent and changed its name to Revo Service Management (RSM). Although a significant rebrand, the majority of the organisation’s information has remained the same (aside from the company website, which can now be accessed at www.revosm.com).\n\nRSM combines people, processes and technology to provide the right ITSM and service partnership for its clients. Striving to optimise efficiency of service organisations whilst simultaneously improving transparency, the industry specialist has developed a line of highly effective ‘best practice solutions’ courtesy of its extensive experience in ITIL, which along with its concentrated expertise in service management software operation, has been repeatedly proven to maximise the performance of multiple businesses. Years in the trade has enabled the team to become seasoned specialists in the deployment and implementation of BMC FootPrints and ITSM and service management products.\n\n“Revo is an IT Service Management consulting, education and technology provider headquartered in the UK and providing services throughout EMEA,” Simon Martin, Managing Director of Revo told us. “Our approach to business driven ITSM leverages frameworks such as ITIL, CobiT and ISO/IEC20000 as part of a hands-on, real-world approach to ITSM that has helped hundreds of companies transform their IT organisations into strategic, business-aligned service providers delivering the highest levels of service and support to their customers while lowering costs.”\n\nOperating in accordance with its solid network of professionals – whom occupy bases across the Europe – enables the pioneering company to provide advanced solutions that have great value in a multitude of industries, adjusted accordingly for different niches, whether devised for multinational organisations or small independents. Promising a long-term working relationship and the provision of quality services and informed, impartial advice has secured RSM as a trusted provider with a glowing reputation for customer satisfaction.\n\nAccording to Simon, the contemporary company has only gone from strength to strength since its foundation and has enjoyed significant levels of growth over the course of 2015 and the first half of 2016: “We are proud of our achievements thus far and are pleased to confirm that we have been doing exceptionally well in recent times,” he divulged. “The last 12 months in particular has been a great period of time for us in the UK. We have increased our revenue by 25% on the previous year and are delighted to reveal that we have built our customer base progressively so that we now serve over 300 clients.\n\n“Our most recent change is our repositioning as a company through the changing of our brand name to Revo Service Management. In terms of custom, most of our product sales come from the BMC portfolio of BMC Track-It!, BMC FootPrints, BMC Client Management and BMC Remedyforce and companion products from Bomgar for secure remote control, Nexthink for end-user operational analytics and Right Answers for KCS certified knowledge management. Going forward we will be introducing SIAM products to market for instances where measuring end to end services is paramount.”\n\nThe company provides both cloud and on premise service management solutions in order to facilitate the increased demand for these particular products in an industry that is thriving and ever-changing (especially when the rapidly developing world of technology is factored in). RSM understands this need for constant innovation and advancement and so prides itself on formulating the best tools for individual projects, carefully considering every process whilst liaising closely with the customer to ensure all specifications are duly noted as appropriate.\n\nThe BMC FootPrints Service Core from RSM is a form of ITSM service desk software that provides automated end-to-end abilities in a nifty device that is simple to install, use and support. Providing an excellent solution for medium-sized organisations, BMC FootPrints 12 has the proficiency to create personalised working experiences for employees with technology that can enhance individual output and gratification as well as the company’s reputation. Integration with other systems (such as BMC Client Management, Active Directory and any SQL Database) is made seamless with its configurable capabilities and IT departments and administrators alike will reap the benefits of an all-in-one solution that can aid business value, efficiency and productivity.\n\nThis product requires no programming and allows users to easily initiate, route, track, and manage incidents as appropriate, whilst a searchable inventory of frequent problems and their resolutions can be built to improve processes for the future. Dashboards and business analytics ensure compliancy whilst boosting uptime through close monitoring procedures and communication is made more efficient with visualisation and reporting features such as the drag-and-drop visual workflow builder, impact analysis and real-time report building. Its mobility means the necessary data can be accessed from various devices, which in turn strengthens the user community with its collaborative functions.\n\nOne example of RSM’s intelligent business solutions is its Alignability Process Model. This particular package – which forms the template for almost every solution provided by RSM - follows a clearly established set of processes, procedures, work instructions and role descriptions which have made positive impacts on hundreds of ITIL process implementations across the world. Its popularity as a core product is due to its unique capability to increase levels of professionalism in service organisations whilst remaining conscious of restricted, predetermined budgets.\n\nOne of RSM’s most significant partnerships, meanwhile, is with ITRP, a system designed specifically for international deployment. The enterprise-class IT service management application comes with a whole host of operational advantages, with workload reduction, smarter working, seamless collaboration and efficient agreement tracking being just a few notable product features. The simplified ITRP addresses a cross-section of challenges via a single solution that can seamlessly slot into any single business, and users can train themselves online with incomparable ease (as no advanced technical skills are required).\n\nTo anyone looking to implement and maintain such a solution, it is important to note that the software cannot be relied upon as a single entity; it is the careful implementation and usage of this tool that will really propel a business to new heights. This is a key consideration that RSM acknowledges and so the team make it their priority to provide the best IT Service Management expertise possible, keeping the customer at the forefront of every project to ensure their needs are met accordingly. Success can be attained with the participation and training of key employees who can utilise the company’s professional services infrastructure to enhance investment in the most impactful way. As a comprehensive business service platform that revolutionises traditional perceptions of ITSM and service delivery, BMC FootPrints is a valuable toolkit that provides results in every circumstance, no matter how complex the application.\n\nWhen asked about the organisation’s main priorities and recent movements, Simon concluded: “Because of our flexible capabilities we have secured a diverse range of customers, effectively meeting the needs of everyone from the smallest organisations to the larger enterprises. We are looking forward to establishing strong working relationships with many more clients because we believe this to be of great importance and we feel this can be achieved through the dedicated promotion of our products and services at various trade shows. This started with the introduction of Revo at the SITS16 show at London Olympia. The show was a huge success for us and we look forward to more opportunities to showcase the business.\n\n“Overall we are incredibly pleased with our progress and are excited about what the future has in store for us. Here at Revo Service Management we feel very honoured to have been presented with the Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) Company of the Year award by Business and Industry Today as it is a reflection of all our hard work at the company. This is a great form of motivation for our team and it is great to receive recognition for our efforts, proving that our commitment to the marketplace hasn’t gone unnoticed.” \n\nIf you would like any more information on the aforementioned services and products then please don’t hesitate to get in touch with RSM today – its team of approachable, dependable and highly knowledgeable specialists will be more than happy to assist you with your enquiries.

          "DetailDescription": "Melt Creative Ltd has been deservedly selected as our Website Developer of the Month; we are pleased to announce here at Business and Industry Today.\n\nThe Warwick-based business started up courtesy of Founder and Owner Matthew Eldridge, who had previously worked for one of the UK’s largest organisations dedicated to helping businesses to grow. He aspired to establish his own brand and the result was Melt Creative, which now holds the reputable status as a tried and tested design service and marketing strategy provider.\n\nThe award-winning specialists produce purposeful websites and marketing materials for individual businesses, helping them to boost conversions and evoke interest in their services and products. \n\n“We stand out from our competitors because although we predominantly specialise in web design, we also know marketing,” Matt told us. “This means we can effectively create websites that can be used as a lead generation and sales tools. \n\n95% of businesses are getting their websites completely wrong. The information they present is purely about the company and fails to establish any emotional attachment between the brand and the user. This is where our marketing expertise comes into place – finding ways to communicate to website visitors by starting conversations and generating leads.”\n\nOnce finalised the online platforms can be effectively launched and strengthened with useful marketing techniques; using paid advertising, social media, public relations, list building, email marketing and automated communication to drive traffic and increase brand awareness and sales.\n\n“We don't just stand out for the quality of work. We believe in treating clients well and prioritise getting the job done without losing momentum, as well as keeping everything simple and jargon-free. Most agencies charge for small amends and telephone conversations, whilst we won't. This is not how to treat and value your customers.”\n\nTurning browsers into buyers is made possible with the creative talents employed at Melt C. \n\nShunning templates, the team develop custom websites that combine beauty and function in line with customer preferences and specifications. \n\nTheir capabilities include web design, graphic design, automated marketing & sales funnels, hosting & domain management, copywriting, conversion optimisation, onsite & technical SEO, content strategy, and e-commerce solutions can be delivered to significantly augment B2C and B2B websites.\n\nProjects can be completed on time and budget, regardless of size or complexity, and customers can rest assured that they will receive the support they are looking for (whether they provide a detailed brief or need assistance planning every stage).\n\n“Our customer base comprises start-ups and SMEs, and we create content covering everything from nurseries and dog trainers to charity organisations and gaming businesses,” Matthew concluded. “Going forward we developing training courses which will help businesses to understand how they can better market themselves online, providing support for different tools and systems across various niches – our first, as an example, has been developed as the ‘Nursery Success Club’.”\n\nIf you're looking for a website to convert prospects into leads, take a look at www.meltdesign.co.uk/hcw\n\nOr contact Melt Design today for further details",
