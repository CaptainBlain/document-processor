        "DetailDescription": "It is essential when evaluating a vacuum cleaner for industrial and\ncommercial cleaning tasks that consideration is given to the relevant\nhazards and that the equipment is therefore specified appropriately.Hazards from dusts and spilled product fall in to two distinct categories;\nthe first is dusts that are hazardous to health. This category includes\nobvious products like asbestos and silica dust, but any dust that can be\nbreathed in by the operator or other personnel in the workplace is likely\nto be hazardous to health to a degree.The second category is dusts that are hazardous in the environment. The\nobvious category is dusts that can potentially cause an explosive\natmosphere, particularly organic products like sugar and flour. Some\nproducts fall in to both categories such as wood dusts, which are both\nhazardous to health and potentially explosive.Selecting an appropriate Industrial Vacuum Cleaner requires consideration\nof the potential hazards which then informs the specification of the\nmachine. BVC \u2013 British Vacuum Cleaners is the leading brand of British\nmanufactured industrial vacuum cleaners. Manufactured by Quirepace in\nFareham, the range includes both M-Class and H-Class machines for dusts\nhazardous to health and ATEX rated equipment suitable to operate in\npotentially explosive environments.BVC equipment is manufactured to order to match the specific requirements\nof individual customers. One of the principal considerations is the choice\nof filter material used for the primary filter. This can be constructed\nfrom several different materials including PTFE coated, fire resistant and\nanti-static materials in addition to standard filter materials. Within\nmachines designed to recover hazardous materials there is always a second\nstage filter, usually a 3rd stage filter, and sometimes a 4th stage filter,\nwith each stage designed for a specific purpose to ensure the hazardous\nproduct is collected safely and that the exhaust air is as clean as\npossible.The range of BVC Industrial Vacuum Cleaners extends from 1kW single phase\nunits to 15kW 3 phase machines. In addition Quirepace supply both\ncompressed air and petrol/diesel powered units. The smaller machines in the\nrange; the IV40 and IV60, are both available as several different versions\nrated as either M/H Class or ATEX, or indeed both, for when dusts are both\nhazardous and require rating for ATEX rated environments.The standards that describe the specifications to conform to M/H Class are\nnot appropriate for the largest machines in the BVC range; the Ti60 and\nTi80 Centurions. These machines, typically with 4-15kW 3 phase multistage\nexhausters are available in ATEX versions, and can also be supplied with\nHEPA filtration to a similar specification to M/H Class units. Again,\nmachines can be configured with filtration against dusts hazardous to\nhealth and with specifications suitable for ATEX rated environments.The choices available to the potential customer are not just related to the\nspecification of the vacuum cleaner itself; the specification of the hoses\nand tools must also be considered to ensure that they are appropriate for\nthe use the machines will be put to.Quirepace\u2019s extensive knowledge combined with our experienced sales team,\nUK manufacture, and local service and spares support, means that BVC UK\nmanufactured Industrial Vacuum Cleaners, with their 5 year parts warranty,\ndeliver excellent durability and value for money in the industrial\nenvironment.In addition to portable equipment, Quirepace also design and install fixed\ninstallations for Central Vacuum Cleaning, where multiple outlets are\nserved by central plant through a network of fixed pipework.Contact us today to arrange an initial consultation meeting.T 023 9260 3700\nsales@quirepace.co.uk\nwww.quirepace.co.uk\nwww.bvc.co.uk\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Assentech has been developing techniques to measure and reduce emissions\nfrom tank farms for over a decade. The key is keeping volatile compounds\ninside the tanks but allowing them to breathe when required such as\nfilling/emptying and fluctuations in temperature. At all other times a\nbreather valve should remain closed with minimal leakage.These valves have immense flow capacity so if not functioning or set\ncorrectly can leak hundreds of tons of invisible GWP emissions along with\ncompany profits into the atmosphere.“We have a deep understanding of how breather vents work and how to\noptimise their performance. As they are modulating pressure relief devices\nthey can begin to open from as low as 75% of their set point. As many\ndigesters run at 90% design pressure this overlap represents a large\npotential for mis-applied devices to leak excessively at standard operating\npressures,” says Cox.Two international standards ISO28300 and API2000 specify maximum leak rates\nfor all production vents, ie. 0.014m³/h for vents up to 6”. The shame is\nthat only 2 out of the 20 worldwide manufacturers test to this standard.\nUnfortunately, the majority of breather valves that are installed at\nfacilities do not seal and will allow huge volumes of vapour to release\ninto the atmosphere.We are the only company who has the technology, knowledge and service\ncapability to keep you safe, compliant and profitable.T +44 (0)1726 844707\ninfo@assentech.co.uk\nwww.assentech.co.uk\n",

      "Description" : "Despite a widening skills gap, by organising advanced technology into highly optimised work cells, manufacturers are maximising productivity through automation",
      "DetailDescription" : "Despite a widening skills gap, by organising advanced technology into\nhighly optimised work cells, manufacturers are maximising productivity\nthrough automation.Specialised equipment, like a deep-hole drilling system, often is\nchallenging to integrate, which quickly can create production schedule\nbottlenecks. To eliminate the risk, shops that perform deep-hole drilling\nshould seek out OEMs that understand the needs of high-production\nmanufacturers and have the capabilities to bring technology into the\nfactories and work cells of the future.Deep-hole drilling systems, which can produce holes that exceed a 20-1\ndepth-to-diameter ratio, are a unique class of manufacturing equipment\nbecause of the focused tasks they conduct. An increasing number of\nmachining centres boast deep-hole drilling capabilities, but these machines\nsimply cannot operate at needed speeds, particularly for parts that require\nexceptionally high accuracy. Manufacturers that must perform deep-hole\ndrilling capable of rapid production and high throughput should instead\nselect machines designed for the task.Automating holemaking\nThese shops increasingly opt for deep-hole drilling systems that also work\nwith automation. In a typical deep-hole drilling work cell configuration,\nsuch as one for producing rifle receivers or automotive shafts, the\nequipment can use automation to time its cycle completion to mesh with\nother production processes. For straightforward automation, conveyors and\npick-and-place robots move and position parts for deep-hole drilling with\nexacting repeatability and accuracy while automatic toolchangers, doors and\ninspection stations keep parts moving swiftly into, out of and around the\ncell.Because deep-hole drilling tends to apply to long, cylindrically shaped\nparts, workpiece configuration eases or complicates some aspects of\nautomating load-in and load-out cycles tied to drilling operations.\nWorkholding axes, for example, can provide automatic part gripping with\npneumatic or hydraulic chucks operated through advanced controls for deep-\nhole drilling systems. In this configuration, machines can pick up a part,\ndrill it and set it back down on a conveyor or part collection area. In\ndeep-hole drilling systems themselves, specialised designs also offer\nautomatic chucking, while robot-tending systems can add further flexibility\nwith end-of-arm tooling, workholding and measuring systems.As the automation configuration grows more complicated, however,\nmanufacturers require an OEM that can act as a collaborative partner to\nfind available solutions or engineer individualised products for unique\napplications or production lines. Shops that depend on deep-hole drilling\nas part of a high-production environment should seek a partner that has a\ndemonstrated record of working directly with manufacturers to modernise\nprocesses and create robust automated work cells.Gundrilling application\nUNISIG, for instance, worked with a manufacturer of rifle barrel receivers\nto help it accommodate growing demand and relieve production bottlenecks.\nThe manufacturer’s older gundrilling machines were replaced by a multiple-\nspindle machine, the UNI25HD. It had the power and controls necessary to\napply indexable gundrilling tools, significantly improving feed rates.To enable fast one-piece-flow manufacturing, UNISIG integrated the system\nvia automation for in-feed, pick-and-place, conveyor loading and automatic\nclamping, which fed two lathes that turned the parts. The result was an\neffective work cell that produced more than 100 parts an hour, a dramatic\nfinancial and process improvement.The viability of automated deep-hole drilling production can depend on tool\nlife and part length. At extreme depths, for example, some parts require\nmore than one set of inserts to produce a completed hole, and the high\nlevel of hardness of some workpiece materials causes rapid tool wear. To\novercome this challenge, UNISIG programs its machines to detect wear and\npredict when a tool will reach its breaking point, allowing operators to\nprevent a failure that could stop the line.For further process efficiency, deep-hole drilling machines should have\neither a CNC or programmable logic controller. Both can integrate with\nother control systems and interface with a controller in the work cell.\nSystems such as a fully automated barrel cell are capable of unmanned,\nlights-out production with efficient programming.Deep-hole drilling equipment’s application-specific configurations suit the\nproduction of parts that necessitate techniques and processes that go\nbeyond the easy capabilities of general-purpose equipment. In years past,\nmany manufacturers thought of this kind of specialized equipment as old-\nfashioned and a drag on production. But with the right equipment – and a\npartner with the right engineering and applications expertise – deep-hole\ndrilling in work cells can keep up with the productive factory environment\nthat manufacturers need to succeed.Further information on all machines of the B Series and the complete UNISIG\nmachine program is available at: www.unisig.de or follow the company on\nLinkedIn and Twitter (@UNISIG).\n",

      "Description" : "A smart, automated, common engine control platform from CHP support specialist Gen-C has boosted gas production by up to 10% at EDL’s Mucking landfill gas power station",
      "DetailDescription" : "A smart, automated, common engine control platform from CHP support\nspecialist Gen-C has boosted gas production by up to 10% at EDL’s Mucking\nlandfill gas power station. The Motortech supervisory panel comprising\nstate-of-the-art ComAp technology controls a suite of five MWM Deutz\nengines on the site. It optimises gas and asset use by adjusting engine\nload in real time to exactly match the available gas coming in from the\nfield. Featuring live alerts, superior fault diagnosis, data logging and\nremote engine control including instant restarts, the Mucking team can now\ntrack, monitor and adjust the performance of all five of their engines at\nonce via a user-friendly app, without needing to be on site.“Engine downtime has been virtually eliminated,” says Dave Dickson, Site\nSupervisor at EDL Mucking. “The Gen-C common control panel automatically\nadjusts the load of each engine to instantly match gas availability, making\nmanual intervention redundant. As well as enabling better use of personnel,\nwe’ve seen between a 5-10% uplift in gas production.”Located in Tilbury, Essex, the EDL Mucking landfill gas power station\nhouses five operational engines: four 1.2 MW Deutz TCG620-V16 models and a\nCaterpillar 3516. Four engines are in constant use, with one acting as a\nreserve. In Spring 2021, Gen-C was commissioned to upgrade four of the\nengines’ control panels to intelligent, open-access Motortech versions, as\nwell as replace the ignition systems (one engine had been upgraded\npreviously). As part of the project, Gen-C’s Managing Director, James\nThompson, also agreed to supply a supervisory common control platform to\nstreamline the management of all five engines.“Having worked with EDL on a number of projects – including upgrading the\nvandalised control panels at their Wellingborough site at the start of the\npandemic – we were keen to optimise their engine management,” says James.\n“We knew that our common control platform would not only ease staffing\npressures by reducing manual intervention but also increase gas\nproduction.”Optimising gas production\nEDL strives to use 100% of the gas available at Mucking, but due to\nreliance on manual engine control, this was not always possible. Dave\nDickson explains: “Before the common control platform was installed, we\nwould regularly assess the suction limit – this is the volume of gas that’s\navailable at any given time and is based on external factors such as\natmospheric pressure; for example, during times of low pressure, gas\navailability increases. We would then manually adjust each engine’s load to\nmeet the suction limit before repeating the process a few hours later,\nincluding throughout the night. However, this reactive response meant there\nwas inevitably a lag in gas uptake; production was not being optimised, as\nthe full amount of available gas was not always able to be utilised.”Since automating the process via the Motortech common control panel, this\nlag in gas uptake has been eliminated. “Now, we set the parameters of the\nsupervisory panel installed by Gen-C according to the suction limit and it\nautomatically adjusts the engines’ load to match it in real time,” says\nDave. “As there is no lag, gas production is optimised, with no under-\nutilisation. It enables a more agile use of our engine assets – the system\nreads how many engines are running, and at what capacity, and detects\nwhether they need to flex up or down to match gas availability. It can stop\nor start individual engines as needed, and even bring the reserve engine\nonline within just 15 minutes if necessary.”Power with control\nAs James Thompson explains, the common control panel intelligently responds\nto real-time information: “The system monitors the pressure of the gas\ncoming in from the field to the various engines. We have translated that\ninto how much load is required to run the engines, to ensure that each one\nis performing optimally.”As well as managing the full suite of engines, the supervisory platform can\nalso isolate and control individual machines: one engine can be set to act\nas a reserve or run to a maximum capacity of 80%, for example; one or more\nengines can be given priority over the others; and engines can be brought\nin and out of service as required. If needed, a member of the team can even\ndial in remotely to access the panel or override it; something they would\nhave previously needed to be on site to do.Superior asset protection\nThis precision control is not only essential for maximising gas production\nbut also for protecting the gas field and the engines. Extracting too much\ngas can result in negative pressure, potentially pulling through siloxanes\nand impurities that can cause an imbalance and risk harming the engines. It\ncan also damage the field, possibly igniting a fire and burning the\nvaluable gas, as well as posing a risk to people and property. Equally, if\ntoo little gas is being extracted from the field, it can start to leach\nout. “These issues have been eliminated since the common control platform\nwas installed,” confirms Dave.Automatic engine handover\nThere are other benefits, too. “Previously, if an engine shut down, we\nreceived an email alert prompting us to restart it manually,” outlines\nDave. “If this happened at night, a member of staff would have to drive to\nsite, find the cause of the fault, then physically restart the engine or\nactivate the reserve. This sometimes incurred a delay of up to six or even\neight hours, during which time the engine would be out of action and gas\nproduction would be reduced. Now, if any engine develops a fault, the\ncommon control panel automatically shuts it down and brings the spare\nonline within just 15 minutes, meaning there is no great rush for personnel\nto attend site. An alarm list is automatically emailed to key staff\ninforming them of the reason for the shut down; if it’s something simple\nlike a fluctuation in gas quality, they can dial in remotely and restart\nthe engine within minutes.”Easing staffing pressures\nWith the supervisory control panel replacing manual intervention, EDL has\nbeen able to redeploy staff to more business-critical areas. “One of the\nkey benefits of the system is that it doesn’t require a person to be\nphysically present in the control room, as was the case previously,” says\nDave. “The number of nuisance trips to restart engines has been\ndramatically reduced and the system is so user-friendly, even incorporating\nan app that we can access 24/7 to check engine performance remotely.\nEverything is visible on just one screen, so it’s easy to track what’s\nhappening.”This remote fingertip control has allowed EDL Mucking to become more\npersonnel-efficient, freeing up staff to be used where they are most\nneeded. This facility has proved invaluable in recent months, as social\ndistancing and pandemic pressures have combined with a national labour\nsqueeze to make efficient use of staff more important than ever for\nbusinesses across the UK.In addition, the system comprises a data log that records engine activity\nand enables the EDL team to spot trends over time, helping them make\ninformed decisions regarding operational improvements.Gen-C’s James Thompson is delighted that his client has seen such an uplift\nfrom the system, “The Motortech common control panel takes continuous live\ndata from all five engines on the site and makes forward-thinking,\nautonomous adjustments to ensure they are operating optimally. It’s not\nonly a portal that talks to each engine; it is a fully autonomous power\ncontrol platform that proactively manages the gas in the field and burns it\nthrough the assets on site in the most efficient way for the engines and\nthe asset owner. As EDL have found, the benefits of this system for\nlandfill gas operators are significant; however, its flexibility means it\ncan also be used to great effect at other power generation sites, such as\nfor monitoring gas bag levels at anaerobic digestion plants.”For more information on the Motortech common engine control platform,\ncontact: james.thompson@gen-c.co.uk\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Essentra Components announces global recruitment drive for sustainablesuppliers Essentra Components has opened a global recruitment drive to find suppliersof sustainable post-consumer plastic recyclate to further increase therecycled content within its injection moulded products and other subsequentproduct lines. The manufacturer has been championing plastics with a higher percentage ofrecycled content in order to reduce its own carbon footprint and those ofits customers by supplying more sustainable products with similar if notgreater performance levels. However, production of post-consumer plastics requires a consistent supplyof sustainable recycled resins, and with the rapid shift towards greenermanufacturing, demand is currently higher than supply due to challengesfaced by recyclers and processors. Strategy and M&A Director at Essentra Components, Richard Sederman,discussed the challenges earlier in the year, saying that competitionbetween manufacturers over such a small supply chain potentiallyjeopardises supply volumes, \"The challenge is that the volume of high-quality recyclate just isn't reliably available in the quantities we needfor us to produce a consistent product, without putting performance atrisk. \"Because of this, our procurement teams are vying for the attention ofevery supplier they can find, occasionally in competition with othermanufacturers to secure enough.\" To support a wider supply chain to boost efficiency, Essentra Componentshas called upon suppliers of all sizes across Europe to take part in anopen procurement process to mitigate the risks manufacturers face. Scott Fawcett, Divisional Managing Director of Essentra Components, saidthe recruitment drive is not just about its own supply but that of thewider industry, \"The supply of sustainable recyclate is an issue that'saffecting the entire industry. For manufacturing to become more sustainablein the future, every link of the supply must be able to cope with thedemands of the market. \"Our customers are already seeing the benefits of higher percentagerecycled plastics, and by forging new relationships and securing moresupply, the possibilities for innovation and future design only growstronger. \"If we can encourage suppliers from a wider network to come forward and bepart of the drive towards a greener industry, then we can build a moresustainable supply chain to support a sustainable industry moving forward.\" The invitation to apply is open to any supplier of any size across Europeand the UK with Essentra Components looking to develop relationships withsuppliers who can both fill the supply gaps and support with materialsinnovation with the aim of enabling the manufacturer to greatly increasetheir post-consumer plastic percentages within their products, ideally asclose to 100% as possible. For more information or to apply as a supplier, please contact:sustainability@essentra.com",

      "DetailDescription" : "In 2020, WFL has manifested decades of expertise in complete machining in a\nmachine that has been entirely redeveloped in terms of its design and\ntechnology. ‘Smart machining’ is at the heart of the technological\ninnovations at WFL, bringing about an increase in performance thanks to the\nmost diverse range of machining technologies. The range of applications\ncovered by the M20 is almost infinite, capable of carrying out the\ndemanding and complex machining tasks found in the aviation, automotive,\nengineering and plastics industries.A particular highlight is the innovative design of the machine. The M20\nMILLTURN has a one piece, straight-lined appearance, with a modern,\nfunctional design. The continuous front made from hardened glass features\nan integrated display of performance data as well a sliding window to the\ntool magazine. The machine’s fresh appearance is further supported by its\nnew colouring. Optimum ergonomics as well as convenient, user-friendly\noperation round off the unique design.The small machine for every task\nWhen developing the M20 MILLTURN, the objective was to introduce a compact\nand rigid machine designed for long-term accuracy. With a length of\n5,500mm, a depth of 3,190mm and a height of 2,500mm, the M20 is ideal for\nmachining the most diverse range of workpieces. The M20 is a machine model\nwith a 250mm or 315mm chuck diameter, with an impressive X-axis travel of\n575mm (+475; -100), Y-axis travel of 260mm (±130) and Z-axis travel of\n1,250mm. The machine is suitable for machining workpieces up to Ø 500mm and\nis equipped with a powerful 44kW (32) main spindle at 40% (100%) duty cycle\nand 4,000rpm. The M20 is equipped with a B-axis and a swivel range of ±120°\nfor unlimited contour machining, as well as with the new 20,000rpm milling\nspindle.This means that there is a universal range of possible applications for the\nuse of high-speed tools. The motor spindle system is designed as a compact\ncartridge assembly with housing flange interface.The machine frame is made from spheroidal graphite, which is extremely\nstrong and guarantees excellent damping characteristics. Thanks to the\nconstruction of the machine, which incorporates vibration-absorbent cast\ncomponents that offer optimum rigidity, even the heavy cuts that are\nrequired during machining are carried out without vibration. Large spaces\nbetween the guide rails and trolleys on the slide guides also guarantee a\nhigh degree of system rigidity.The configuration of the machine allows for a wide range of possibilities:\nfrom a pure complete machining centre with steady rest and tailstock, as a\ncounter spindle machine with tool turret or an individual tool holder at\nthe bottom, as well as an optional integrated workpiece handling system.Tool management & automation\nThe tool magazine can hold maximum 40 or optionally 80 tools with HSK-63 or\nPSC63 (Capto C6) accommodation. The maximum tool weight is 10kg and the\nmaximum tool diameter is 90mm (adjacent) or 130mm (non-adjacent). In\naddition, the lower compound slide with tool turret can hold 12-24 tools.\nIf necessary, the machine can be equipped with a bar feeder. A particular\nhighlight is the automatic tool change into the lower individual tool\nholder with B-axis. This makes it possible to set up the tools parallel to\nmachining time and then automatically access tools in the magazine. Stored\ntools can therefore be placed in the upper and lower tool holder. The\ninternal coolant supply to the tool holders takes place at maximum 80 bar.Based on the customer’s specific needs, different automation options are\navailable for automatic workpiece loading and unloading. An integrated\nworkpiece handling and/or loading system, which can be added on the right\nside of the machine, represents a completely new variant of automation. The\nmain guide rail for the handling system runs into the working area from the\nright. The gripper slide moves on the guide piston and can load and unload\nworkpieces in this way. The workpieces are stored on a strip accumulator.Huge variety for every application\nThe integrated motor spindle concept as a fundamental of the machine turns\nhigh dynamics into a reality. The M20 is perfectly suited to universal and\ndemanding machining processes. The X travel at -100mm beneath the\ncenterline also opens up new opportunities for complete machining. A drill\npattern with a circumference up to a diameter of 200mm can be drilled by\nmoving the XY coordinates, without moving the workpiece. The two B-axis\nsystems in the machine also offer undreamed-of possibilities for machining\nthin-walled, funnel-shaped turbine parts.The simultaneous B-axis turning is extremely useful here. The interpolating\nNC-driven B-axis is also suitable for turning with a pivoting B-axis.\nThanks to the continuous adjustment of the setting angle during the cut, a\ncomplex contour (eg. for turbine wheels or piston heads for large diesel\nengines) that would normally require multiple tools can be produced in a\nsingle cut. This reduces on the number of turning tools required and\nproduces a seamless machining result.New operator panel with modern design\nFor the controls, WFL relies on Siemens technology, namely the 840D sl. The\ncontrol interface is visualised on a touchscreen. One of the many aspects\nthat determine the performance of complete machining centres is the\npotential of the control system. The IPC 477E Industrial Flat Panels are\nideally suited for use as screens and boast fast response times for\ninstantaneous screen updates. The innovative multitouch variant with\nwidescreen 24 inch front in 16:9 format and Full HD (1,920 x 1,080) is\ninstalled on the M20 MILLTURN.Another special characteristic is the fact that the display can be divided\nand various programs can be displayed on multiple sub-sites. This allows\nfunctions such as WFL iControl process monitoring, graphics, programs,\nstatistics and real-time data to be displayed in parallel. All of this\nresults in optimized performance.The CrashGuard, CrashGuard Studio and Millturn PRO programs can be\ndisplayed in the header bar in a clearly structured way. The window below\nthis is used to display information on axis loads, tools, the CrashGuard\nViewer, axis movements in real time and much more. This provides operators\nwith a large number of options for monitoring their manufacturing process.www.wfl.at\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "When David Rybacki founded DRG Manufacturing in the Chicago suburb of Lake\nZurich in 2015, he started off with nothing except a commitment to\nmanufacture total solutions for his customers. Since he was not basing his\nproduction process on existing equipment, he set out to incorporate\nautomated systems and processes that would provide him with the highest\nlevels of productivity.\n\nDRG serves the firearms component industry, and the shop’s commitment to\nquality has yielded dramatic results. In three years, it has grown from six\nto 40 employees and has increased its business eightfold.\n\n“Business has been very good to us,” Rybacki said. His commitment to making\nparts that exceed expectations has much to do with that success. DRG\ncreates parts to three specific, equally stringent sets of specifications:\ntheir own internal specs, MIL-SPEC prints that constitute industry\nstandards, and custom OEM prints supplied by individual customers.\n\nThe company approaches every new product and component build as an\nopportunity to produce it with the most effective process possible. One of\nthe keys to that productivity has been DRG’s fully automated gundrilling\nand reaming cell from UNISIG.\n\nBefore Rybacki invested in this cell, he evaluated several other\ngundrilling machines. “Most were limited to manually operated equipment\nthat would not accomplish Rybacki’s objectives. Only UNISIG offered a\nrobotically run cell that could provide the functionality and flexibility\nDRG required,” said a company spokesperson.\n\n“Many companies in our industry put an operator in front of every machine,”\nRybacki explained. “Instead, our UNISIG automated cell gives us about a\n150% production increase over such manual operations.”\n\nDRG’s automated cell runs barrel blanks with chamfers at each end. A robot\npicks up a blank from an infeed system and loads it into a dual-spindle\nUNISIG UNE12-2 gundrill machine with a 12mm maximum part diameter\ncapability. After the drilling process is completed, the robot moves the\nblank to a dual-spindle UNISIG UNR20 reamer.\n\nOnce the automatic reamer completes its part of the process, the robot\nmoves the blank to a blow-off station to clear oil from inside the barrel.\nFrom there, the robot transports the blank to the outfeed station, where it\nexits the cell to be rifled. All aspects of the cell are automated,\nincluding the vision system with automatic compensation that allows the\nshop to quality check every part before human hands ever touch them.\n\nDRG’s completed automated gun drilling process simplifies completion of\nlarge orders with long delivery schedules. Most of the shop’s workflow\ninvolves long-term contracts and multi-month purchase orders for 1,000 or\nmore barrel blanks. That workflow makes production planning easy because\nthe company can establish shipping dates and work backward to create the\nbuild schedule. To meet their commitments, DRG normally runs three shifts-\ntwo attended by an operator and one unattended at night.Including the\nUNISIG cell, DRG has a total of five automated cells within the factory\nthat operate a full 24 hours of every day.\n\nWhen DRG receives a purchase order, it processes half the part total up\nfront so larger volumes can enable them to amortise set-up costs over\nlonger runs. In addition, DRG’s Kanban inventory system enables the shop to\nmaintain a replenishable inventory of high-demand parts for same-day\nshipping. Because the shop must be highly responsive to changing customer\ndemands, inventory makes it possible to source smaller orders that DRG\notherwise would refuse.\n\nOriginally, DRG outsourced profiling and barrel manufacturing work. But\nlarge orders and stringent specifications called for specialised equipment.\nFor this reason, DRG acquired its UNISIG drilling and reaming cell in 2017\nto produce raw rifled blanks.\n\nAlthough DRG has the option of running the UNISIG R-2A rifling machine as\npart of its automated drilling and reaming cell, that is one process\nRybacki prefers to keep manual. “We run rifling manually so we can QC it\nand make certain that all aspects are perfect,” he said. “DRG’s QC\ndepartment air gauges everything the company makes, although the cost of\nthe QC equipment is steep: about $12,000 per caliber.”\n\nAmong the other attributes that set DRG Manufacturing apart from its\ncompetitors is its commitment to automated equipment. Rybacki realises that\nsome companies may shy away from implementing automated cells because of\nthe upfront time involved in development and set-up.\n\n“It is about being patient to achieve the results you want,” Rybacki said.\n“We can buy machines from UNISIG, put them on our floor and run them\nmanually – or we can wait about six months longer and buy a fully automated\nturnkey system that runs perfectly.” He noted that the extra time\ninvestment enables DRG to double its production without adding personnel or\nshift hours.\n\nWhen it comes to workpieces, DRG works with some challenging materials and\ntight part tolerances. It manufactures most of its parts from 416R pre-\nhardened chromium stainless steel and 4150 Chrome-Moly Vanadium, or CMV. On\na 17” rifle blank, for instance, total indicator runout is kept to under 10\nthousandths, with diameters at under one thousandth and size within a\ncouple of 10 thousandths.\n\nUNISIG’s application support plays a key role in DRG achieving its quality\ntargets with tough part materials. As Rybacki pointed out, “They are\nexperts in deep hole drilling, and they taught us everything we needed to\nknow. The learning curve was just a matter of mastering tool life, which\nthey gave us suggestions on. After receiving guidelines on how to start we\njust took it from there. It is not trial and error because of UNISIG’s\nexpertise. It is only trial and error if you do not listen to them.”\n\nFor the immediate future, further expansion at DRG will have to wait.\nAlthough DRG has not reached volume capacity, its growth and success has\nled to no available shop floor space. Automation has enabled DRG to\nincrease its process efficiency and boost production output. But Rybacki is\nquick to point out that robotics only work in a shop with the right people\nto operate them. “You still need people,” he noted. “People can grow into\nnew opportunities. Robots do not take over completely.”\n\nUNISIG is also exhibiting at the EMO show in Milan, Italy from 4-9 October\n2021.

      "DetailDescription" : "RIn this issue of Industrial Process News, we are proud to announce that we have selected 123 Insight Ltd as our Management Software Company of the Month.\n\n“123 Insight Ltd is the developer and distributor of the 123insight MRP/ERP manufacturing system.” Stated Martin Bailey, Marketing Manager.\n\nFounded in 2000 by Guy Amoroso and Craig Grant, after years of experience and work with traditional MRP/ERP vendors. 123 Insight Ltd was created to provide an alternative to ‘traditional’ MRP/ERP systems. The company provides its award-winning 123insight MRP/ERP/CRM manufacturing management software along with integration into various accounts packages, which is diverse and applicable for a range of industries.\n\n“The product was designed specifically to be suitable for all shapes, sizes, types and style of manufacturers. We have customers in various industries, our smallest customer maintains a staff of two, and the largest has over 4500.” Said Martin.\n\n123 Insight Ltd created its software and business model as a response to the fundamental flaws, that were noticeable in traditional systems. Dedicated to improving upon these flaws for both customer and supplier, its software was specifically designed to address issues such as: high initial costs, long implementation times, expensive consultancy, annual maintenance and regular version update fees. 123insight provides a simple low-cost monthly subscription covering both the product and support, boasting full pricing transparency and no minimum contract period.\n\n“We use the tag line ‘Advanced Simplicity’, as the software is very easy to learn, but given our no-risk, no minimum period subscription we often say ‘If it doesn’t work for you, it doesn’t work for us’.” Martin expressed.\n\nDetermined to break the mould of traditional systems, 123insight is truly innovative and unique, delivering an easy to use, highly intuitive, affordable and risk-free solution.  \n\n“Aside from the product itself, we have a unique and risk-free evaluation process. Prospective customers can attend one of our online events to satisfy themselves that the product could be a good fit for their business.” Martin continued, “If they are ready to proceed they can attend the six days of training (for the entire system) under no obligation, meaning that if they were to decide not to move forward with 123insight afterwards they walk away with nothing to pay. After that, it’s just a low monthly subscription which can be cancelled at any time.”\n\n\nAdapting to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company responded to the needs of its customers, evaluating and implementing new ways of business. “Due to the pandemic, we rapidly reworked how prospects can evaluate our product with online sessions, which have worked well. We also recently published a book on how to implement MRP software. Available on Amazon, we also give away free paperback copies to all companies that attend our online events. It’s a great template for implementing any MRP system, not just our own.” \n\nMartin continued, “The 123mobile has helped many of our customers during the pandemic. It allows staff to perform stock room and shop floor tasks like booking stock in or clocking on/off of jobs, aids social distancing and reduces the need to share PCs on the shop floor.”\n\nIn terms of the company’s ongoing plans, the future seems bright for 123 Insight Limited, with aims to continue to innovate the industry and improve upon its products and services through consistent development. “As a third of our subscription revenue is ploughed back into development there are always new and innovative features around the corner. We are also aiming to return to trade shows either later this year or early in 2022.” Said Martin.\n\nFor any more information, please see the details below.\n\nT 01489 860851\n\nwww.123insight.com",

      "DetailDescription" : "Despite a widening skills gap, by organizing advanced technology into highly optimized work cells, manufacturers are maximizing productivity through automation.\n\nSpecialized equipment, like a deep-hole drilling system, often is challenging to integrate, which quickly can create production schedule bottlenecks. To eliminate the risk, shops that perform deep-hole drilling should seek out OEMs that understand the needs of high-production manufacturers and have the capabilities to bring technology into the factories and work cells of the future.\n\nDeep-hole drilling systems, which can produce holes that exceed a 20-1 depth-to-diameter ratio, are a unique class of manufacturing equipment because of the focused tasks they conduct. An increasing number of machining centers boast deep-hole drilling capabilities, but these machines simply cannot operate at needed speeds, particularly for parts that require exceptionally high accuracy. Manufacturers that must perform deep-hole drilling capable of rapid production and high throughput should instead select machines designed for the task.\n\nAutomating Holemaking\n\nThese shops increasingly opt for deep-hole drilling systems that also work with automation. In a typical deep-hole drilling work cell configuration, such as one for producing rifle receivers or automotive shafts, the equipment can use automation to time its cycle completion to mesh with other production processes. For straightforward automation, conveyors and pick-and-place robots move and position parts for deep-hole drilling with exacting repeatability and accuracy while automatic toolchangers, doors and inspection stations keep parts moving swiftly into, out of and around the cell.\n\nBecause deep-hole drilling tends to apply to long, cylindrically shaped parts, workpiece configuration eases or complicates some aspects of automating load-in and load-out cycles tied to drilling operations. Workholding axes, for example, can provide automatic part gripping with pneumatic or hydraulic chucks operated through advanced controls for deep-hole drilling systems. In this configuration, machines can pick up a part, drill it and set it back down on a conveyor or part collection area. In deep-hole drilling systems themselves, specialized designs also offer automatic chucking, while robot-tending systems can add further flexibility with end-of-arm tooling, workholding and measuring systems.\n\nAs the automation configuration grows more complicated, however, manufacturers require an OEM that can act as a collaborative partner to find available solutions or engineer individualized products for unique applications or production lines. Shops that depend on deep-hole drilling as part of a high-production environment should seek a partner that has a demonstrated record of working directly with manufacturers to modernize processes and create robust automated work cells.\n\nGundrilling Application\nUNISIG, for instance, worked with a manufacturer of rifle barrel receivers to help it accommodate growing demand and relieve production bottlenecks. The manufacturer’s older gundrilling machines were replaced by a multiple-spindle machine, the UNI25HD. It had the power and controls necessary to apply indexable gundrilling tools, significantly improving feed rates.\n\nTo enable fast one-piece-flow manufacturing, UNISIG integrated the system via automation for in-feed, pick-and-place, conveyor loading and automatic clamping, which fed two lathes that turned the parts. The result was an effective work cell that produced more than 100 parts an hour, a dramatic financial and process improvement.\n\nThe viability of automated deep-hole drilling production can depend on tool life and part length. At extreme depths, for example, some parts require more than one set of inserts to produce a completed hole, and the high level of hardness of some workpiece materials causes rapid tool wear. To overcome this challenge, UNISIG programs its machines to detect wear and predict when a tool will reach its breaking point, allowing operators to prevent a failure that could stop the line.\n\nFor further process efficiency, deep-hole drilling machines should have either a CNC or programmable logic controller. Both can integrate with other control systems and interface with a controller in the work cell. Systems such as a fully automated barrel cell are capable of unmanned, lights-out production with efficient programming.\n\nDeep-hole drilling equipment’s application-specific configurations suit the production of parts that necessitate techniques and processes that go beyond the easy capabilities of general-purpose equipment. In years past, many manufacturers thought of this kind of specialized equipment as old-fashioned and a drag on production. But with the right equipment—and a partner with the right engineering and applications expertise—deep-hole drilling in work cells can keep up with the productive factory environment that manufacturers need to succeed.\n\n\n\nFor further information on all machines of the B series and the complete UNISIG machine program is available at www.unisig.de or follow the company on LinkedIn and Twitter (@UNISIG).",

      "DetailDescription" : "When David Rybacki founded DRG Manufacturing in the Chicago suburb of Lake Zurich in 2015, he started off with nothing except a commitment to manufacture total solutions for his customers. Since he was not basing his production process on existing equipment, he set out to incorporate automated systems and processes that would provide him with the highest levels of productivity.\n\n\n\nDRG serves the firearms component industry, and the shop’s commitment to quality has yielded dramatic results. In three years, it has grown from six to 40 employees and has increased its business eightfold.\n\n\n\n“Business has been very good to us,” Rybacki said. His commitment to making parts that exceed expectations has much to do with that success. DRG creates parts to three specific, equally stringent sets of specifications: their own internal specs, MIL-SPEC prints that constitute industry standards, and custom OEM prints supplied by individual customers.\n\n\n\nThe company approaches every new product and component build as an opportunity to produce it with the most effective process possible. One of the keys to that productivity has been DRG’s fully automated gundrilling and reaming cell from UNISIG.\n\n\n\nBefore Rybacki invested in this cell, he evaluated several other gundrilling machines. “Most were limited to manually operated equipment that would not accomplish Rybacki’s objectives. Only UNISIG offered a robotically run cell that could provide the functionality and flexibility DRG required,” said a company spokesperson.\n\n\n\n“Many companies in our industry put an operator in front of every machine,” Rybacki explained. “Instead, our UNISIG automated cell gives us about a 150% production increase over such manual operations.”\n\n\n\nDRG's completed automated gun drilling process simplifies completion of large orders with long delivery schedules. Most of the shop’s workflow involves long-term contracts and multi-month purchase orders for 1,000 or more barrel blanks. That workflow makes production planning easy because the company can establish shipping dates and work backward to create the build schedule. To meet their commitments, DRG normally runs three shifts-two attended by an operator and one unattended at night. Including the UNISIG cell, DRG has a total of five automated cells within the factory that operate a full 24 hours of every day.\n\n\n\nOriginally, DRG outsourced profiling and barrel manufacturing work. But large orders and stringent specifications called for specialised equipment. For this reason, DRG acquired its UNISIG drilling and reaming cell in 2017 to produce raw rifled blanks.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to workpieces, DRG works with some challenging materials and tight part tolerances. It manufactures most of its parts from 416R pre-hardened chromium stainless steel and 4150 Chrome-Moly Vanadium, or CMV. On a 17\" rifle blank, for instance, total indicator runout is kept to under 10 thousandths, with diameters at under one thousandth and size within a couple of 10 thousandths.\n\n\n\nUNISIG’s application support plays a key role in DRG achieving its quality targets with tough part materials. As Rybacki pointed out, “They are experts in deep hole drilling, and they taught us everything we needed to know. The learning curve was just a matter of mastering tool life, which they gave us suggestions on. After receiving guidelines on how to start we just took it from there. It is not trial and error because of UNISIG’s expertise. It is only trial and error if you do not listen to them.”\n\n\n\nUNISIG is exhibiting at the EMO show in Milan, Italy from 4-9 October 2021.

      "DetailDescription" : "PPSPower is one of the industry’s largest and most respected providers of back-up generator and UPS service, maintenance, repair and installation services. With origins dating back to 1956, the company has the experience, expertise and innovative mindset needed to offer its customers the most cost-effective and efficient solutions available.\n\n\n\n“Our solutions can be easily customised if needed. We do have standard contracts available, but if it makes sense to do things differently for a particular customer, we can,” explained Stephen Peal, Managing Director.\n\n\n\nIndeed, PPSPower prides itself on its consultative approach for each new customer. “Companies may not be aware of the costs of downtime if power is lost and processes stop. Or, if they do have a back up power system in place, we can help identify how long this might last for and if it’s fit for purpose. We can talk to process companies and work out whether this is good enough for what they need, or if they need something else brought in, and find the best solution for their situation.”\n\n\n\nPPSPower’s UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supplies) are an excellent way to protect mission critical processes. “If you’re processing something and don’t want a break in power, then this is the set up you need. If the UPS is working properly, you won’t even know if there’s been a power cut, because everything will carry on running smoothly without even a flicker in the lights.”\n\n\n\nOffering a wide range of affordable UPS solutions, PPSPower is an authorised Riello UPS reseller and service provider. This means the company can provide compact, free standing or rack mounted user-friendly single-phase UPS solutions for small to medium sized businesses, which ensure reliability and availability from 700 VA to 20 kVA. PPSPower also offers revolutionary backup power supplies and standby diesel generators for large networks and data centres. This includes three phase Riello UPS solutions from 10 kVA to 800 kVA and scalable to 6.4 MVA, providing class-leading availability, scalability and high efficiency suitable for today’s demanding IT environment.\n\n\n\nWhat’s more, PPSPower can offer specialist UPS solutions for use in harsh environments and external applications, and industrial UPS from 30 kVA to 125 kVA. There is also a selection of UPS battery solutions to meet any autonomy requirements and space/floor load restrictions that may exist at a facility. \n\n\n\nTo complement this range, PPSPower’s expert UPS engineering team provides site surveys, installation and commissioning services, UPS and battery load bank testing, UPS end-user products training, and UPS after sales service and maintenance contracts. Whatever your requirements, PPSPower is there to offer support through the entire process of your UPS installation. With comprehensive, competitive and tailored UPS maintenance packages, PPSPower ensures peace of mind and a solution to suit your budget.\n\n\n\nPPSPower also offers a Green Contract, which provides a sustainable way of carrying out proper preventative maintenance on a generator, if appropriate for the company. This includes two site visits a year, one minor and one major. Both of these visits consist of 56 checks, which include a 26-point engine check, a 24-point battery, control panel and electrical system check, and a 6-point fuel system check for safety and reliability. If a company requires anything additional to this, PPSPower also offers a Red Contract, which includes additional tasks.\n\n\n\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching consequences, PPSPower has managed to pull through and is now just as strong as it was before. “We were affected for about a month of the lockdown period, and were at about 50% of our normal turnover. But we took advantage of the furlough scheme and we’re now back to where we were before.\n\n\n\n“I think the main reason for this is because of the variety of market sectors we work in. Obviously, we weren’t doing any work in the hospitality or events industries because they were significantly affected by the pandemic. But we were still working with the NHS and hospitals, and now people are beginning to return to work we’re seeing other market sectors start to pick up again too.”\n\n\n\nCertainly, having pulled through the challenges imposed by the last several months, PPSPower is primed to continue its growth and help ensure its customers stay up and running.

      "Description" : "Automation inside deep-hole drilling machines can be more valuable than part handling outside of them",
      "DetailDescription" : "Automation inside deep-hole drilling machines can be more valuable than\npart handling outside of them.\n\nFor deep-hole drilling, part-handling might be the most visible automation\nelement, but it’s not necessarily the most impactful. Often, it’s internal\nprocess automation that yields the most significant results even with a\nmanually loaded drilling machine.\n\nWhen it comes to automating deep-hole drilling, there are challenges unique\nto the process itself. These include fixturing complexities — where\nmaintaining alignment requires elements such as guide bushings and tool\nsupports not present in a conventional lathe or milling machine — and part\nattributes such as length and weight.\n\nLong parts mean a long drilling cycle time, and maintaining production\nrates often requires multi-spindle, deep-hole drilling systems.\nUnfortunately, stopping a two- or four-spindle machine means two or four\nspindles sit idle until the parts are loaded and unloaded. So, in these\ninstances, the more parts in the machine at one time, the more automation\ncan actually inhibit cycle time while the machine is running.\n\nSolving this problem in multi-spindle machines requires internal automation\nto achieve the objectives of lean manufacturing and one-piece flow. In-\nmachine loaders singulate processes so that even within a small four-piece\nbatch you maintain one-piece flow. The operator or automation device puts\nin a part and takes a part out, and the machine does a bit of manoeuvring\ninside to sequence those four parts in such a way as to minimize spindle\ndowntime while maintaining upstream and downstream processes for one-piece\nflow. For instance, parts could be loaded onto a smart conveyor, indexed,\nand lifted into chucks for the drilling cycle before robotic unloading on\nthe out-feed side so that there are no bottlenecks to a steady production\nflow.\n\nTool life management is another form of internal automation. Getting\nfeedback to the machine enables the deep-hole drilling process to adapt or\nhalt, if necessary, before tools and parts are damaged.\n\nTool life management is built into a machine’s control, and the machine\nsenses torque thrust and coolant. Chip condition is usually the first\nindicator of wear, which would otherwise require an operator present to\ndetect, so the machine actually monitors the process and can predict tools\nstarting to wear and identify when they need to be changed. A tool life\nmanagement system also can count distances drilled and the number of\ncycles, then prompt a tool change at the appropriate time.\n\nThat kind of in-machine automation smooths the path for external\nautomation. As the process builds, highly standardized options for robot-\nready machines such as an automatic door, workpiece-present sensors and\nprogrammable workpiece fixturing makes it easier to add a robot at a later\ndate. These robot-ready machines also create efficiencies before they’re\nfully automated. Even with manual loading, the automatic doors and\nprogrammable clamping make the process more efficient.\n\nIn UNISIG’s experience, an embedded reamer tool changer enables\nmanufacturers to manage significant throughput increases, even with an\noperator. With this technology, operators can maintain the pace of\nproduction loading the machine, while eliminating the task of inserting\nreaming tools for each cycle. This allows the operator to redirect efforts\ntowards tasks such as additional quality checks and off-machine setups.\n\nwww.unisig.com\n",

We know we\nneed to be on the ball to make things happen for our customers and ensure\nthey get what they need quickly, so we pride ourselves on our efficient and\ncomprehensive services.”\n\nComplete part traceability is essential for compliance with ISO quality\nstandards, a matter which is pertinent to a vast range of industries. This\nlevel of traceability begins with part marking, and choosing laser marking\ntechnology allows manufacturers to automate marking operations and ensure a\nhigh level of control.\n\n“Our laser marking machines are fantastic products; they are reliable, high\nstandard and produce an excellent quality mark. As soon as a customer\nreceives one, they realise and appreciate how good the machines are.”\n\nSIC Marking’s laser engraving technology consists of a high frequency beam\ngenerated from a laser source, which is then amplified and directed towards\na part to be marked via a series of rotating mirrors.\n\nFibre laser marking is widely recognised as one of the most effective\nmarking technologies, offering numerous solutions for any industry. SIC\nMarking has chosen the Ytterbium-doped fibre laser for its powerful\nreliability and low operating costs, making it ideal for company’s looking\nfor a cost-effective solution for their traceability needs.\n\nHaving only been established in the UK since 2017, SIC Marking is seeing\nexcellent levels of expansion, with 50% growth each year so far. “Our team\nhas also grown, we’ve employed a new Field Service Engineer who brings a\nwealth of experience to the company, and we are constantly diversifying\nwith new products. The global company invests 10% into R+D every year, so\nthere is always something in development.”\n\nSIC Marking maintains a busy calendar of events each year, including the\nManufacturing Supply Chain Conference and Exhibition, Southern\nManufacturing Show, Northern Manufacturing Show, MACH, the Engineering\nExpo, and the Advanced Engineering show. “Shows are really important for\nus; because we have such a diverse customer base, we can get lots of\ninterest and leads during the event and increase our brand’s awareness\nacross the country.\n\n“Raising our profile is a big thing for us at the moment. Lots of people\nhave our products but don’t know who we are, as we were only established in\nthe UK a few years ago. This is why we’re trying to find our existing\ncustomers who might not know we exist, as well as expanding our customer\nbase with new clients.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more information on everything SIC Marking\nhas to offer, head to the website or get in touch using the contact details\nbelow.\n\nT 01926 830372\nsalesuk@sic-marking.com\nwww.sic-marking.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Industrial Process News is proud to announce that We Are Lean And Agile has been selected as our Business Process Improvement Company of the Month, for its market leading software and training which aids the continuous improvement of its customers’ processes and workflow.\n\nBased in Torquay in the south west of England, We Are Lean And Agile has a nationwide customer base, helping businesses in a vast range of sectors. 'It’s all about improving processes; every workplace needs to do this to succeed, thrive and deliver growth,' explained Andrew Sandford, Director. 'We’re equipping people with the tools to establish sustainable ongoing capabilities to deliver their own improvement programmes, so they don’t have to source external resources.'   \n\nThe company has been a partner and added value reseller for Engage Process, a software company based in the Netherlands, for the last four years, raising awareness and offering training for their innovative business process mapping software, ENGAGE™. 'This software makes it easier for companies to understand cost, improvements and see the benefits of change. It allows collaboration on processes and enables them to see an end-to-end improvement cycle,' explained Andrew. 'We focus on delivering this software, before training customers on how to use and get the best out of it to improve their processes.\n\n'ENGAGE™’s primary benefit is that it offers a way to better and faster capture and understand processes, which can then be shared with stakeholders. It features user-friendly icons, and the times are embedded into the processes to form a fully costed process model, where a business has captured improvement ideas in the workshop. All of this helps to design new and better processes.\n\n'You can also collaborate in the platform itself, reducing the number of emails to be searched by offering a single source of data, allowing you to build and share processes in one place. As would be expected, this results in huge time savings; a Business Analyst can save around 30–40% of their time by using ENGAGE™.'\n\nThe ENGAGE™ Process Suite features a range of modules, and the ENGAGE™ Process Modeler is the main powerhouse of the suite including mapping, modelling, analysing and process simulation. The Modeler offers a powerful environment for process modelling and design, with design, workshop modes, evaluation and Lean functions. Paper workshops and sticky notes can be replaced with live process mapping, enabling you to share your processes immediately after the workshop and encourage greater participation.\n\nAs well as this, there are a range of supporting modules, including the Brainstorm App, which synchronises with the ENGAGE™ Process Modeler, allowing you to quickly add additional queries and notes to your process. This can be accessed at any time on Android, Apple or Windows phone platforms. Other modules include Tables, User Manager, Feedback, Publisher, Upload, and Teamboard. 'We’re excited to introduce the new Teamboard structure for continuous improvement sessions,' Andrew elaborated. 'This helps to support more agile projects. In the next update there will be complete configurability, making it a very useful addition to the suite.'\n\nAs well as the ENGAGE™ Process Suite, We Are Lean And Agile also offers a range of workshops, coaching and consultancy services to help customers to improve their processes. This includes Lego Serious Play Workshops, Playing Lean Workshops and a Continuous Improvement Consultancy.\n\n'We’re seeing a need and drive to embed Continuous Improvement throughout an entire organisation. One of our clients has embedded it throughout the company and has achieved huge savings. So we’re focusing on creating help and guidance on growing the use of our tools within a business to help them reach the high performance culture people are striving for. We’re always looking for other additional and complementary products to add further value to our offering.'\n\nOne of We Are Lean And Agile’s main missions is to spread the word about the significant benefits of implementing the ENGAGE™ Process Suite. 'We regularly attend trade shows. It’s essential for us to raise awareness and show the capabilities of the software,' Andrew said. 'People don’t know there’s a solution out there and are still using flipcharts and sticky notes. We want to let them know that ENGAGE™ exists, and show them how much it can help them. We go to Govcamp and Health Camp, and the Lean, Productivity and Continuous Improvement Summit in Milton Keynes, as well as a range of specific events aimed at improvement.'\n\nWithout a doubt, We Are Lean And Agile is offering businesses an astonishing opportunity to bring about a fundamental change in their processes and to develop sustainable capabilities to maintain these improvements.

      "DetailDescription" : "Contrary to public opinion, the UK is one of the leading nations when it comes to manufacturing output. We currently rank ninth in the world, and produce £3.82 billion to our economy from our manufacturing and process businesses (Office for National Statistics).\n\nHowever, the gridlock of Brexit is dragging the UK economy close to stalling point and fears are growing that the UK could be heading for its first recession in a decade. With the news from the Office for National Statistics of the first fall in quarterly GDP raising concerns that if renewed Brexit jitters, leading up to the new 31 October departure date, could create a second successive quarter of negative growth – the technical definition of a recession. This combined with their report in July that consumer spending is also its’ weakest since the mid-90s, might suggest the writing is on the wall.\n\nIt’s no surprise then that growing numbers of manufacturing and processing businesses are delaying their spending plans, or cancelling their investment all together due to the uncertainty in the current marketplace, and not having a clear view on how Brexit could affect their supply chain.\n\nBusinesses are now deciding to go to Europe themselves rather than exporting, putting off investment all together and, as Make UK Chief Executive Stephen Phipson describes it, “building inventory like crazy”.\n\nThe current uncertainty in the marketplace is forcing businesses to hoard more inventory, meaning that their stock holding capabilities need to improve rapidly to deal with the increased levels. One way of achieving this, is to digitalise their business, and introduce a sophisticated and sustainable business software solution.\n\nThe fourth industrial revolution is currently taking place, with digitalisation touching every aspect of life, specifically businesses. The introduction of next generation business software is allowing businesses to thrive in this time of uncertainty, automating their stock holding processes and giving them a full and clear overview of their whole business.\n\nIt’s critical that UK businesses have next-generation digital infrastructure in place. The UK is taking steps to cement its position as a world leader in future technologies of full fibre and 5G through the £740m of funding from the National productivity investment fund that the chancellor announced last year.\n\nThe top companies are digitalising well, and there are numerous examples of medium-sized companies that are starting to do it quite well in implementing these techniques.\n\nMr Phipson identifies that the challenge is the long tail - the 90% of businesses that are SMEs – and ‘really getting them to realise the value of investment’ and what they can achieve through digitalisation.\n\nTo understand how digitalising your processes can help your business, contact Azzure IT today.

      "DetailDescription" : "‘To address the engineer skills shortage and to keep up with manufacturing demand, UK manufacturers would need to recruit an additional 203,000 skilled engineers each year until 2024, according to a government study.’\nNumerous studies are reporting that the engineering skills shortage is one of the main concerns facing British Manufacturing today and yet each year, there are thousands of engineering students that do not secure a career in engineering.\nMSC Industrial Supply Co, a market leader in the supply of Metalworking and MRO industrial consumable items, is acutely aware of the engineer skills shortage that is causing great concern for many of its customers, especially within SME (Small to Medium-sized Enterprises) manufacturers. \nDave Darby, Managing Director at MSC, comments “At MSC we are exposed to thousands of engineering firms which enables us to deeply understand the challenges that they face today and tomorrow. To address the engineering skills shortage, we have been strengthening our best in class national engineering team. Our engineering team has saved significant time and costs for hundreds of our customers. That said, we recognise that this can only satisfy part of the problem, which is why we have been searching for a partner that can help our customers recruit and inspire the next generation of engineers. We are now very excited to announce that MSC has formed a partnership with Next Gen Makers”.\nNext Gen Makers are a new start-up business based in the West Midlands. Their purpose is to address the engineering skills shortage by inspiring the next generation of engineers in colleges and schools in the West Midlands to pursue a career in the sector, then help to place them in manufacturing companies that need to take on engineering apprentices.\n‘In the West Midlands alone, there is a shortage of 20,000 young engineers every year. Which is very concerning when you consider that there are around 22,000 Engineering and Manufacturing firms in the region.’\nAdam Tipper, Owner-Director of Next Gen Makers, comments: “there is clearly an engineering skills shortage in the UK and yet there are thousands of engineering students looking for apprenticeship opportunities each year that struggle to find employers to take them on. This is because they lack awareness of engineering companies in their local area. We are actively working with colleges and secondary schools to bring companies and students together via our innovative model. We also work to inspire more young people to look at a career in the engineering sector. I am excited about the prospect of working with an industry leader like MSC, who are passionate about supporting UK Manufacturing. Their engineering experience and capabilities make them the ideal partner for us.\n\n\nMany SME engineering firms view taking on an apprentice as overly complicated and feel that they are unable to invest the time needed. However, the reality is somewhat different.\nApprenticeship schemes help to ensure employers get the knowledge, skills and behaviours they need while growing a talented and engaged workforce, often filling skills gaps. Apprenticeships can be tailored to specific job roles, making them flexible to the needs of a business. \nThere are additional benefits to injecting some youthful talent into a workforce which is often overlooked, all of which can help to improve business performance. For example, younger workers can add a fresh perspective and new ideas. In turn, this can excite existing employees and spark a boost in overall business productivity. Apprenticeships also provide firms with skilled workers that they need for the future and to embrace the latest technologies. The process of taking on apprentices also encourages companies to take a closer look at the way they do things because they are passing on knowledge and expertise to people keen to learn the trade or business. This can lead to improvements and increased efficiency.\nWhile having an individual within the workforce that can act as a mentor for the apprentice is essential; employers should not be put off by misconceptions surrounding the time required to invest in the training and development of an apprentice. New Apprenticeship 'Standards' mean an employer can expect to save time in the long run by having an individual that is guaranteed to be suitable for their specific role within the business. \nAnyone considering an apprenticeship can be reassured of these positive benefits it brings to individuals and workplaces across the industry.\nThe partnership between MSC and Next Gen Makers is all about making a positive change to the lives of many young engineers and engineering firms. Working together, they will address the major problem that faces UK manufacturing today and for years to come.\n\nT 0800 663 355\nsales@mscdirect.co.uk\nwww.mscdirect.co.uk",

      "DetailDescription" : "Industrial Process News is proud to announce that AMA Xpert Eye Ltd has been chosen as our Communication and Collaboration Company of the Month, for their pioneering use of Smart Glass technology to help businesses succeed across the globe.\n\nAs a sister company of Ubisoft, a global giant in the gaming industry, AMA Xpert Eye was founded in 2001, originally to provide gaming and lifestyle software for very early smartphone technology. After providing these applications for Google, AMA decided to apply to use the new Google Glass technology, and in 2013 they became one of 10 companies selected to enter the ‘Glass at Work’ programme.\n\nThen, in 2014, AMA assisted surgeon Philippe Collin, who had to travel to Japan three or four times a week to teach. AMA worked with him at CHP St Grégoire and facilitated the first real-time global transmission using Smart Glass technology, between Rennes and Nagoya, with Professor Goto.\n\nAfter this, AMA decided to focus on the business usage of Smart Glass technology, and was one of the first companies to take this technology outside of America. Using Augmented Reality (AR) to offer remote collaboration to those working in maintenance, healthcare, teaching and transport, to name a few, AMA’s solutions help businesses save time and money, and sometimes lives. AMA ensures that specialists, doctors, and engineers can provide fast intervention and offer better quality assistance to their customers. Indeed, by eliminating the need to travel, an expert using AMA’s solutions can support more people in less time.\n\nAlong with their headquarters in France, AMA opened subsidiaries in the US in 2015, Germany, London and Bucharest in 2016, and this year they will open in Hong Kong, with goals to establish themselves in Spain and throughout Asia. 'Our subsidiaries are the key to us remaining close with our customers and users of our technology,' says Etienne Guillemot, Director. 'We want to ensure a smooth introduction to it and facilitate a company’s digital transformation, and we also have dedicated project management to help customers. We believe this global presence is essential for us to succeed in what we do.\n\n'We are focused on continuing to add more potential to our technology and ultimately more value to the industry,' explains Etienne. 'We are looking to add more video feeds and devices such as optical microscopes to help with more precise operations in healthcare. We already have industrial endoscopes in use with our Smart Glass technology, which can be used to see inside things such as engines, and we are also looking to develop a range of heat cameras. \n\n'At AMA, our main goal is to allow users to communicate and collaborate in a single environment. We’re enlarging our range of basic features, such as calendars and white boards, so we can cover as much ground as possible and provide a platform which means the user doesn’t have to switch between different software. We also offer dedicated devices for our Xpert Eye technology, such as a smartphone or computer, and we are committed to offering high levels of security and encryption for sensitive data.'\n\nIt is without a doubt that AMA is at the forefront of innovation in remote collaboration, with a vision to move the world forward and develop their technology to make it accessible to everybody. Now employing 110 people and continuing to grow exponentially, AMA Xpert Eye Ltd is fast becoming a world leader in this new and exciting industry.

In 1983 these two product groups added the first aluminium profile, the forerunner of the BLOCAN® Profile System. RK Rose+Krieger’s innovative energy quickly helped them to reach a position of growing economic significance. However, considerable investment costs soon meant that a strong partner was needed; this was found in 1987 with the internationally active Phoenix Mecano Group. With the support of this Swiss group of companies, RK Rose+Krieger began to expand worldwide, and today they are a leader in the design of assembly and positioning systems. \n\nRK Rose+Krieger’s main focus is to provide products and services to their extensive range of customers, who are found in almost every area of manufacturing. “The speed at which we respond to customers, and the level of our after sales support, I believe are second to none,” says Michael Kiley, General Sales Manager. “We can assist with design based upon customer’s initial concepts and also offer a full assembly service if required. As a company we are always striving to look for new ways to advance our products. For example, we have recently introduced a new 100% corrosion resistant unit to our popular range of E type tubular linear units within our linear technology range of products. This unit has an upgraded working temperature range of -30 to +80°C and can operate with FDA approved lubricants.”\n\nIndeed, their range of linear units with screw and belt is extensive, with many size and length options available. RK Rose+Krieger also manufactures electric lifting columns for height adjustment of workstations and benches, and electric actuators for positioning and adjustment.\n\nAnother exciting new product they are launching is their RK monitor mounting compact. This is a new smaller mounting, expanding on their range of extremely popular monitor mounting components, which offer a high-strength and flexible solution for the fixing and adjustment of monitors and touch panels.\n\nWhat’s more, their tube connection system offers a cost effective solution for the positive and easily detachable connection of a wide variety of systems, without the need for drilling and welding.

      "DetailDescription" : "Compound tables for converting a 3-axis vertical machining centre (VMC) into a 4-axis or full 5-axis machine are becoming increasingly popular. They boost output by reducing the number of component set-ups, often enabling one-hit production, and minimise tolerance build-up for higher accuracy machining. Fixturing costs are lower, handling is significantly less and smaller batches can be produced economically, substantially reducing manufacturing cost per part.\n\nProvided that a rigid, high quality table from Japanese manufacturer Kitagawa is purchased from sole UK agent 1st Machine Tool Accessories, the metal cutting configuration will be just as robust and accurate as the rotary axes on true 5-axis machines.\n\nKitagawa manufactures the world’s largest range of NC rotary tables, covering single- and multiple-spindle, tilting, and waterproof models. They can be configured with the motor on the right, left, back or top. Table diameters range from as small as 100mm, including some with built-in 5C spindles, up to 500mm.\n\nMost models can be supplied with a number of options including integral ports in the faceplate to enable hydraulic fixture operation, allowing workpieces to be secured automatically. Depending on the application, numerous table variants are available in sizes that offer high speeds and increased clamping forces for heavy duty cutting.\n\nThe most popular tables can be configured for use in conjunction with the Kitagawa Quinte controller. Using a simple M code, a table can be operated from any CNC system, providing versatility to swap work between 3-axis VMCs with different controls. Another option is to operate the Quinte controller through an RS232 connection, which allows the rotary table to be controlled via the machine CNC, eliminating the need for two separate programs.\n\nA notable design feature of Kitagawa rotary tables are the cross roller bearings, which ensure compactness, rigidity, high positioning accuracy and the ability to have large through-holes, without sacrificing performance. Elastic displacement due to the bearing load is minimal and in addition, the table is able to withstand complex loading in the radial and axial directions as well as twisting moment.\n\nThe rotational torque of cross roller bearings is lower than that of plain bearings and the difference between the static and kinetic torque is small. Therefore the bearings minimise power consumption and operating temperature and increase the overall efficiency of the table.\n\nThrough 1st Machine Tool Accessories, Kitagawa offers various options to complement its rotary tables, such as manual, pneumatic or hydraulic tailstocks, tail spindles with built-in clamping system, trunnion assemblies, rotary joints, air/hydraulic intensifiers, and manual, pneumatic and hydraulic chuck systems.\n\nT 01725 512517\nenquiries@1mta.com\nwww.1mta.com\n",

Good communication skills bring high-pressure water jetting operatives into decision-making processes, so risks can be properly discussed and mitigated.\n\n“Also, operatives are more likely to take an active part in sharing important issues relating to their work if they have full confidence in their communication skills, and that comes from effective training.\n\n“This is just as important when using remotely-controlled robotic water jetting systems as specialist teams need to communicate between themselves and with onsite personnel using verbal or visual signals.\n\nAll WJA training emphasises and gives instruction on the importance of effective communication when carrying out water jetting. That includes, where appropriate, the use of hand signals.\n\nGood communication skills build trust between colleagues and within wider work teams. This helps ensure instructions are given and received with clarity, especially when supervisors may not be on site, and give operatives the confidence to challenge actions that may undermine safety.\n\nTo be registered with the WJA and receive a Certificate and Photo ID Card, a trainee must attend a one-day class-based Water Jetting - Safety Awareness course.

Kingston engineering has benefitted significantly from their renowned success, enabling Kingston Engineering to flourish within their industry and enabling the company to further their development and manufacturing processes.\n\nIn regards to the achievement of their 100 year milestone, Kingston Engineering has established themselves as an experienced manufacturer with a continuous devotion to advancing through constant investments in their products, throughout their 100 years of trade. Excelling in engineering excellence, Kingston Engineering showcases 100 years of skilled, expert and customer focus based history. Through these advancements and changes in technology, the company has maintained its presence in the market and gained global recognition and presence. Industrial Process News explored the company’s vast history and outlines how the company has gone from strength to strength, within each decade.\n\nThe beginning of Kingston Engineering came after the devastating aftermath of the First World War. Originally starting in hull, in their first site on Dansom Lane, the company started trading as Hull Motor Transport and Engineering Co, manufacturing pistons and providing cylinder grinding. Starting small, the company provided car and commercial vehicle repair within the local motor trade. Maintaining its original prospects, is something that Kingston Engineering prides themselves on, dating back to their leadership of Robert Markham and Thomas Simpkins, who designed the business around the concept of giving a bespoke customised personal service for clients, which is something the company still  adheres to today. \n\nWith only 10 employees, the business was smaller and extremely customer service focussed, in early years, creating growing success. Expansion was clearly on the horizon for Kingston engineering, even within the early years enabling Kingston Engineering to be able to provide general engineering services. This success and reputation, later expanded further for the company, with Kingston engineering obtaining a renowned reputation for repairing both saw milling machinery and printing machinery. \n\nKingston Engineering Co. Ltd eventually gained its name in 1924 and the development of manufacturing screws began in 1930, which has proved to be a very significant departure for the business \n\nExpanding through decades marked by World War One, and World War Two is something that not many businesses could achieve, however 1930-1945 saw expansion for Kingston Engineering, with World War Two bringing in a development of manufacturing components required for aircraft undercarriages. Leading the company to expand and develop its manufacturing facilities, (Kingston Engineering was very fortunate to be mostly unaffected by any bomb damage.) Kingston Engineering’s expertise and experience helped them maintain and expand throughout these hard decades. In fact, their workforce also increased within 1930-1945, through the high demand of their services. \n\nThe evolution of the company during the next 20 years, took flight at the end of World War Two. Operating from a larger site in Pennington Street, Kingston Engineering began their successful journey of specialising in screw manufacturing. Even within these early years, Kingston Engineering began to engage with their ethos of investing in the company, leading them to increase their skills through the installation of new modern machinery. Their skilful repute gave Kingston Engineering the perfect platform in growing and exporting globally, as their specialist screw manufacturing brought in a new market, expanding to Australia and South Africa.\n\nThe arrival of the sixties saw a shift in terms of counter sales for Kingston Engineering, the company moved from motor sales to industrial sales. Furthermore, the sixties contained many major development factors for the company including, investments in the factory, expansion in exporting, the purchasing of modern machinery, expansion of product range and an ‘Off the Shelf’ service introduced. The company now had extremely well-equipped workshops, enabling them to accommodate facilitates for milling, shaping, welding, grinding and turning. Through accommodating these facilitate, Kingston Engineering further expanded their Factory premises. Their product range advanced notably within this era too, leading to a vast range of Screws, Sprockets, Chains, Pumps and bearings; there was also an expansion for their sprayed coating services where Kingston Engineering now offers the service for worn components. In terms of their exporting, Kinston engineering saw further developments within this span of 20 years and had now began exporting across Europe. In 1979, the company celebrated its milestone of 60 years and was being run by two direct descendants of the two founding families. \n\nThe introduction of the digital years throughout the eighties, saw the rise of new advancements within engineering industries. Digital technology further increased Kingston Engineering’s already established skills and gave them the perfect tool in broadening their production skillset. \n\nMoving onto recent years, Kingston Engineering has now established a dominating presence within the engineering sector. With more and more technological advancements being used within manufacturing, Kingston Engineering has developed significantly, in terms of modern machinery and in-house facilities. \n\nExamining their amazing 100 year of production up to today, Kingston Engineering has built an extremely positive reputation which has allowed them to produce top of the range products. Through such a detailed rich history of skilful work behind them, Kingston Engineering has shown great flexibility, showcasing the adaptability of the company, throughout the decades. Supported by their expert team and managed by working directors, their skills and experience, are at the heart of the company’s success. With a great customer service focus, Kingston Engineering provides a quick, efficient service with help from their 40 plus skilled workforce. It is clear to see how Kingston Engineering has become one of UK’s leading specialist manufacturers and producers of bespoke Power Screws.\n\nMaintaining the company’s successful 100 years, has never been more important to Kingston Engineering. Inspired to further themselves, they even have recent developments, including investment in a new Mituoyo Euro M544 Measuring Machine, which has become a significant tool for their inspection department. The machine allows Kingston Engineering to measure the physical geometrical characteristics of an object. The machine creates printed inspection reports and is controlled by an operator, with measurements designed by a probe attached to the third moving axis of the machine. Proving to be a great example of Kingston Engineering’s commitment to constantly improving through investing, the machine benefits the company/clients significantly, especially through the machine producing an accurate drawing of the part that can be used for the manufacture of bespoke items. \n\nKingston Engineering’s current directors are Paul Bielby, Mike Hutchinson and Gill Hickson, who are leading the company to achieve and maintain its established, excellence and professionalism within all aspects of their business. Through their unrivalled skills and years of experience, they are clearly setting the way for Kingston Engineering and helping the company deliver its exceptional services to their customers.\n\nA privately owned business, this prestigious 100 year milestone is a testimony to the company’s sheer determination to invest through their skilled team of workers, facilities and technologies. It is clear to see that over the years, the company have significantly invested in their machinery for continued success. The company’s current directors have an unprecedented, more than 100 years of experience between them and are continuously engaging in plans to help the company become global leaders in screw manufacturing.

      "DetailDescription" : "Curtiss-Wright has a commendable history behind it, having been founded by three of the world’s most celebrated aviation pioneers, Orville and Wilbur Wright and Mr Glenn Curtiss, one of the forerunners of naval aviation. Their companies, the ‘Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company’ and ‘Wright Aeronautical Corporation’, merged in 1929 in order to create Curtiss-Wright. Today Curtiss-Wright is one of the world’s leading advanced engineering companies, having diversified and branched out into numerous different technologies across multiple sectors, including commercial and industrial, defence, power, metals, aerospace, and much more.\n\nAt the turn of the 21st Century, Curtiss-Wright had grown into a multinational company, with global sales of over $2 billion and having acquired almost 60 businesses. Many of these companies still operate under their original name, such as Metal Improvement Company, Bolt’s Metallizing, IMR Test Labs, Component Coating and Repair Services and more who now are part of Curtiss-Wright Surface Technologies. These various divisions offer a wide variety of different specialised surface treatments such as thermal spray coatings, solid film lubricants, shot peening technology and much more.\n\nCurtiss Wright Surface Technology, one of its most well-known and international subsidiaries, specialises in providing material surface treatment solutions, focuses on enhancing the performance of critical materials and components. As many of its clients are in heavy engineering based industries, critical components are often of vital importance. Not only do they need to be specially designed to precision specifications, but they need to be long lasting and properly maintained too. Curtiss Wright Surface Technology can offer clients a comprehensive material treatments service that covers silicone, plastic and electronic components, coatings, shot and laser peening, material analysis, testing, repair, and maintenance.\n\nCurtiss Wright Surface Technology can provide mechanical and metallurgical testing services for a range of different materials and components through IMR Test Labs. Curtiss-Wright Surface Technologies uses only the most advanced technology and methods in order to conduct fatigue testing, thermal spray coating analyses, metallurgical and failure analyses, accelerated weathering and corrosion testing, weld testing and much more.\n\nWhen it comes to engineered coatings, Curtiss Wright Surface Technologies has a wide scope of services, including providing thermal management, corrosion and erosion, and protection and repair of turbine components. Curtiss-Wright Surface Technology can provide protective engineered coatings or metal coatings to protect components from the environment, corrosion, heat, and wear. As it can ensure protection for components of any size or complexity, it has a vast client base made up of those seeking its protective coating services, including the aerospace, oil, gas, automotive, and medical industries.\n\nIts range of coating solutions includes thermal spray/HVOF coatings, solid film lubricants, liquid coatings, and parylene conformal coatings. Not only that, but Curtiss Wright Surface Technology also offers repair and overhaul for gas and steam turbine components, as well as laboratory testing and process verification for: salt spray corrosion testing, UV testing and development of its own bespoke coating systems such as Everlube®, Microseal, and Flurene Lube-Lok®, sacrificial aluminium coatings, diffusion coatings and pre-treatments.\n\nMetal and material surface solutions are a huge part of why Curtiss Wright Surface Technology has become such an internationally recognised name. In addition to its famous controlled shot peening process, the company can provide highly effective and controlled Laser Peening for components in turbine engines, aircraft structures, wing skins, and more. This specialist process puts exceptionally deep residual compressive stress in certain parts of a component to prevent crack initiation and fatigue. Not only does this allow the component to resist damage from erosion, strike damage, fretting, and corrosion, but it can also better withstand pressure from both low cycle/high stress and high cycle/low stress situations. Better yet, its laser peening ensures quality control, precise application, and poses no risk of process contamination.\n\nPreventing the failure of critical components is a huge concern for clients, and is one of the most highly sought after services from Curtiss Wright Surface Technologies. Problems can be caused due to any number of reasons throughout the component design process, whether it’s the choice of materials used, incorrect assembly, or damage to the parts caused by bending, rolling or forging. Components of any type can be damaged, such as blade roots, rotating rings, and tie wire holes used in Aero-Engines, fasteners, and stringers used in Airframes, and torsion bars, gears and keyways, which are used to make Crankshafts and more.

      "DetailDescription" : "Direct Air: Leading name in compressed air\nIndustrial Process News is proud to present Direct Air and Pipework with our coveted Compressed Air Company of the Month profile.\n\nDirect Air and Pipework specialise in providing industry leading solutions surrounding everything compressed air and pipework. The company was founded in 1993 by Managing Director Allan Dolby, as a family run business. From their head office in Coventry, the company have since become one of the UK’s premier choices for compressed air and pipework solutions. In 2004, they invested in a new facility in Cheltenham, allowing them to cement their footprint in both the Midlands and South West markets. Now, just over two decades on from their inception, they operate on a national scale, and have worked for clients abroad in Slovakia, France and even South Africa.\n\nApproximately 70% of all companies use compressed air for some aspect of their operations, with around 10% of all the industrial electricity consumed in Europe used to generate air. The equipment used to generate the air is referred to as a compressor which takes a gas, usually air, and compresses it into a smaller space. Air compressors use different technologies, including water, oil or fans, to achieve this outcome.\n\n\nThe company have numerous air compressors available, distributing and installing systems from CompAir, BOGE, Hydrovane, Bambi and more leading brands. When leading on installation projects, they tend to favour aluminium systems over galvanised steel as it is lighter, more resistant to rust, and easier to manoeuvre and install. \n\nAs air compressors and pipework are used in a plethora of applications, from manufacturing to supply chains, Direct Air have become a respected name across engineering, aerospace, automation, food processing and pharmaceuticals. Better yet, they offer a free compressed air system assessment to find clients the right solution for their needs. \n\nWe spoke to Marketing Manager Emma Dolby about their services, to which she explained, “We offer everything to do with a complete compressed air system; supply of all equipment including downstream, installation, after sales support and ongoing maintenance. In addition, we also have inhouse project management capabilities, where we can create bespoke systems in accordance to client needs. We can provide 2D and 3D CAD design, creating models and drawings of compressed air systems, pipes and plants.”\n\nIn recent years, there has also been growing demand for on-site nitrogen generation. Typically, Nitrogen is obtained through liquid N2 delivery and high pressure compressed gas cylinders. However, Direct Air install and service nitrogen generators to deliver gas on-site which is a more reliable, safer and cost-effective method. Emma explained, “Our nitrogen generators can be configured to meet our customers’ specific requirements. The installation is wonderfully simple too, just connect a compressed air line to the nitrogen generator package and connect the generator outlet to your own nitrogen line, and you’re set.”\n\nNot only that, but Direct Air also offer oil free air solutions. Oil is a huge concern for many different processes, as even a drop can damage equipment, ruin products and disrupt production. “We have multiple oil free solutions to achieve essential air purity for our customers, which include oil free compressors or oil lubricated compressors with filtration.”\n\nThe last few years have been particularly exciting for Direct Air, who were recently selected to be one a few selected oil free specialists with access to CompAir's Ultima oil free solution. Direct Air were extremely proud to take delivery of the very first Ultima compressors in Europe. Boasting a 12% energy efficiency and allowing for a 37% smaller carbon footprint, the Ultima guarantees reduced energy consumption and hence reduced energy costs. Last year, Direct Air also won the Northern Europe Oil Free Distributor Company of the Year award, as well as UK Compressor Distributor of the Year, selected by Gardner Denver. \n\nDirect Air also have a robust after sales support service team. All contracted customers have access to their 24/7 response unit, which is particularly good for production facilities which tend to run 24/7. Their maintenance engineers are all manufacturer trained and are able to be on-site within 24 hours’ notice. \n\nThis year they are celebrating their 25th Anniversary and underwent a transformative rebranding in February. With a new logo, new website and reaffirming their commitment to always deliver the very best products whilst practising great communication, expertise and technical guidance, Direct Air demonstrate why they are the number one choice for all compressed air requirements. \n\nIf you would like to know more about Direct Air’s excellent services, then don’t hesitate to get in contact today.

      "Description" : "In medium volumes, there is little difference between the cost of producing machined castings in China and in the UK",
      "DetailDescription" : "In medium volumes, there is little difference between the cost of producing machined castings in China and in the UK\n\nZinc and aluminium high-pressure die casting specialist RD Castings has used Japanese-built, high-speed, twin-pallet machining centres from Brother since 1989 and currently has nine of them adding value to its products in two machine shops in Mildenhall, Suffolk. Since the mid-90s, the 30 taper machines have replaced manual milling, drilling and tapping, which was both labour intensive and subject to quality variation.\n\nRunning the company are siblings Anthony and Michael Pateman, who were interested when Brother’s UK agent, Whitehouse Machine Tools, suggested they see a demonstration of the machine manufacturer’s new ISO control with 12 inch colour LCD screen, the CNC-C00, a significantly faster and more user-friendly CNC system fitted to its latest machines.\n\nAfter they visited the agent’s Kenilworth showroom and technical centre at the end of 2016, they came away not only with up to date information on the new control’s capabilities, but also having ordered another Brother machining centre, a Speedio R650X1 with Nikken rotary 4th axis. It was not their intention before the visit, but the machine was so productive and such a good fit for RD Castings’ needs that they placed the order on the day and invested in a second identical model within six months.\n\nNumerous facets make the machine particularly applicable to machining light castings, one being its outstanding speed. Workpiece changeover is completed entirely within the 3.4 second rotation of the twin-pallet Quick Table, as the 21 pocket magazine’s 0.9 second tool change time, 50m/min rapids in X Y and Z, and rotation of the 4th CNC axis are carried out simultaneously.\n\nThe first tool is ready to cut the next component immediately it arrives in the machining area and little time is wasted on each subsequent exchange of the cutter due to the rapid tool-to-tool time and spindle acceleration from zero to 16,000rpm in 150 milliseconds, with similarly fast stop time.\n\nMichael Pateman commented, “The speed of tool change on the R650X1 mirrors that of our Brother 324N and R2A machine models, where the tool carousel encircles and travels with the spindle, which does not have to move away to pick up a new cutter as on the Brother TC32A and 32B machining centres that we also have on-site.\n\n“It results in very high productivity that is enhanced by faster processing of existing programs in the new CNC-C00 control. For example, we recently reduced a 3.5 minute cycle by 20 seconds with no change to the original program. If we are machining say 20,000-off parts annually, the saving runs into thousands of pounds.”\n\nAnthony Pateman pointed out another advantage of the R650X1, namely the generous axis travels of 650 x 400 x 305mm in X, Y and Z. The table accepts RD Castings’ 500 x 350mm base plates on the trunnion fitted to both machines, allowing multiple components to be fixtured for 2-axis and 3-axis machining, relieving the load on the 324Ns and R2As which are always filled with work.\n\nHe added, “There is a trend towards larger castings these days and we have just installed a 500 tonne casting machine to meet the requirement. In order to machine them, the ability of the R650X1 to swing our 400mm diameter parts in the rotary axis means that we are often able to finish these bigger castings in one hit and save on a second set-up operation, which hugely decreases cost of production.”\n\nTo underline this comment, he pointed to a casting of about the size that used to need a second operation but is now machined in one 4 axis process, saving 70p per part.\n\nSimon Hale, CNC machine shop manager, stated that productivity of another part – an aluminium die cast housing for the rail industry – has been nearly doubled using the larger machine compared with the other Brother models with similar tool carousels. 17 castings per hour were drilled and tapped using 12 tools on the latter machines, whereas using a trunnion fixture on an R650X1, 32 parts per hour come off the machine after each pallet rotation and just eight tools are needed. \n\nThe increase in output is partly because, by routing coolant at the uprated 30-bar pressure on RD Castings’ latest machines through an indexable-insert drill rather than employing a twist drill, it is possible to produce larger holes above 18 mm diameter in one spindle movement, rather than having to spot and then peck drill the holes multiple times.\n\nMichael Pateman asserts that manufacturing costs are increasing in Asia while the lower pre-Brexit value of the pound is helping UK competitiveness. \n\nHe summed up, “By employing ultra-high-speed machining techniques on 30-taper rather than 40-taper machines, with extensive use of polycrystalline diamond inserts clamped in dynamically balanced tool holders, the cost of producing a casting is now about the same in Mildenhall as it is in China – and we are winning back business as a result. \n\n“The latest Brother Speedios with their larger working envelope have added considerable versatility to our shop floor, as they can economically machine anything from the simplest, smallest casting up to the largest and most complex. Productivity is also up due to the faster control and by allowing more flexible production planning.”\n\n“All of our Brother machines work flat out eight hours a day and their speed, accuracy and reliability are fantastic. Coupled with the high level of support from Whitehouse, it has been an unbeatable package for us.”\n\nwww.rdcastings.co.uk\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "It’s lightweight, strong, recyclable and the most abundant metal on Earth - but there’s a lot to keep in mind when you use it. Nord-Lock Group gives us their best advice on how to join aluminium parts with bolted joints.\n\nAluminium has dominated the aerospace industry for over half a century. In the last 10 years, other industries also started turning to this miracle metal. According to David Harris from ALFED, the federation representing the aluminium industry in the UK, the reason for this is its many benefits, “Aluminium is light, strong, and easily fabricated into extrusions and other casts. It has good corrosion resistance, and can be joined by welding, adhesive bonding and mechanical methods. It can be anodised and painted to give a wide range of attractive finishes that improve appearance, and further enhance corrosion resistance. Aluminium is also a good conductor of electricity: better than copper by volume, and a quarter of the price. It’s a good conductor of heat. And, crucially, at the end of its very long life, it’s recyclable again and again - with no loss of quality.”\n\nDespite this long list, the money men of the automotive industry favour aluminium for one simple reason: it’s lightweight. Considerable weight savings lead to both improved energy efficiency and a more appealing product: Ford, for instance, claims that their F-150 pick-up truck with its aluminium body is 700lb (about 318 kilos) lighter than other truck models.\n\nJoining aluminium parts together\nThere are several suitable ways to join aluminium parts: welding, soldering, gluing and nailing, as well as bolted connections. \n\nThe later method is advantageous for when the joint needs to be opened regularly (e.g. to perform maintenance). We asked Nord-Lock Group, experts in bolted connections, for their advice on how to best join aluminium parts together by using bolts and nuts. \n\n“It’s hard to give clear advice, as it very much depends on the aluminium used,” starts Frida Cullin Persson, Project Manager at the Nord-Lock Group, who has a background in material science.\n\n“Both steel bolts and stainless steel bolts can be used together with aluminium; however, we recommend that you check with your supplier about the type of aluminium you’re using and the environment you’re using it in. Get guidance on how to avoid galvanic corrosion as well,” she adds.\n\nUsing aluminium bolts instead of steel is rare. It’s more common to use standardised steel fasteners (for example, steel bolts class 8.8), since they’re stronger and less expensive.\n\nBut, “Aluminium bolts can be a good choice when the joint is exposed to temperature variations,” explains Cullin Persson. “Using bolts made of the same material as the clamped parts decreases the risk of having increased stresses in components, or dropped clamp load due to different thermal expansions.” \n\nThings to keep in mind\nSince aluminium deforms easily and does not support high pressures, you should consider reducing the load when clamping aluminium parts together with steel fasteners. Alternatively, placing a washer underneath the bolt head can help distribute the load over a larger area, which permits higher clamp loads. One possible solution for this is the Nord-Lock wedge-locking SP washer, with an enlarged outer diameter.\n\n“We recommend using the SP washers together with flanged fasteners, which are common in lower property classes,” adds Cullin Persson.\n\nWhen using a threaded hole in aluminium, it’s also important to remember that the minimal threaded engagement length is longer for aluminium than for steel. A threaded insert might be necessary to increase the thread strength of the hole, particularly when the joint is often retightened. \n\nAluminium use in different industries\n•  Transport: The lightweight nature of aluminium reduces overall weight (and therefore fuel consumption) of cars, trucks and trains. Especially important in aerospace\n• Mechanical: All sorts of applications due to its strength and ease of machining\n•  Construction: Widely used for windows, facades and roofs: its good resistance to corrosion results in low maintenance costs\n•  Electronics: Similar conductivity to copper but with less weight\n• Packaging: Both flexible applications such as menu trays, food containers and plain foil, and rigid applications such as food and drink cans and aerosol cans\n•  Sports equipment: Lightweight, easy to shape into different parts.\n\nDid You Know?\nTwo variants of the metal’s name exist. Aluminium is the preferred spelling in Europe, Australia and by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Aluminum is in common use in the United States and Canada, and considered an acceptable variant by the IUPAC.\n\nDid You Know?\nPure aluminium is rarely used for industrial purposes. Instead, it’s usually mixed with copper, magnesium, manganese, silicon and zinc to create aluminium alloys.\n\nwww.nord-lock.com\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "We are all consumers of finished goods from the textile industry. But have you ever considered the immensely complex processes required to develop the raw materials which create the products you’re wearing?\n\nTextile production requires a scientifically driven process to meet critical performance requirements such as sub-zero temperatures; weather resistance; flexibility; and weight reduction in thread-types and finished fabrics. All supported by a highly specialised and distributed global supply-chain. Indeed, few industries have such a high level of collaboration between raw material developers and finished goods suppliers.\n\nA leading global textile developer and producer, have been grappling with this challenge for some years, and recently embraced BOXARR software to unravel the complex inter-dependencies involved in supplying materials to brands such Nike and North Face.\n\nBOXARR software is enabling people across the client to collaboratively build digital twin models of their complex organisational challenges; capturing human knowledge & expertise through the intuitive medium of Boxes and Arrows. These BOXARR models can readily scale-up to reflect the ‘real world’ breadth, depth, and fidelity of inter-dependencies involved – with the ability to incorporate hundreds of thousands of ‘Boxes’ and millions of data objects.\n\nThe client is using BOXARR to combine process-mapping with data ingested from disparate information systems across their business; rapidly generating a model incorporating the various aspects of their development and production operations. The model maps the web of inter-dependencies between the plethora of material types (threads and fabrics) and the permutations of individual processes required to produce, treat, test and deliver them. This is further combined with contextual information relating to the global supply-network of raw material producers, labs, and production plants.\n\nStakeholders across the client can now visualise and analyse the holistic system-of-systems across their business to help solve problems and optimise outcomes; quickly and effectively. BOXARR’s powerful filtering capabilities enable any selected aspect of the model to be isolated and then display the ‘contributing aspects’ upstream and ‘affected aspects’ downstream of it - a true digital thread within a digital tapestry of inter-dependencies.\n\nBOXARR software incorporates a powerful Functions Framework, which enables users to create, save and apply simple or sophisticated analyses to their models. These Functions are akin to writing formulas in spreadsheets but can leverage the additional dimensions in BOXARR to process data along and between paths; apply contextual filters; and heat-map or format objects.\n\nIn addition, BOXARR enables users to switch between representations of the model on demand: as a network system-of-systems; as tables of data; as pivot reports; as Gantt chart schedules; as swim lanes; as dependency matrices; as overlays on geographical maps; and as interactive dashboards of charts & graphs.\n\nNow the client can effectively minimise risk by simulating and evaluating the propagated effects of proposed decisions/changes in production design or product developments before they are implemented. Informed decisions can now be made to expand or terminate new development cycles or create production plans using globally available facilities; all done while exposing true cost and resource requirements stemming from these decisions. Likewise, diverse impacts of unforeseen events can be readily visualised, enabling the timely deployment of remedial actions.\n\nBOXARR was originally developed to support complexity management in the aerospace & defence sectors; utilised by organisations such as Airbus, Boeing, BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Raytheon, Safran, and Babcock; along with the UK, US and Australian militaries.\n\nThe challenges of complexity are universal and burgeoning. BOXARR’s capabilities are now rapidly being adopted by other sectors, such as manufacture, automotive, technology, healthcare, enterprise, government, and consultancy. \n\nTo learn more about how BOXARR can help optimise your operational performance, visit http://BOXARR.com\n",

Similarly, our Goliath and ExcelAir machine films can\nstretch between 100 and 300 percent, which means that each roll can wrap\nfar more pallets than a conventional film. As a result, far less wrapping\nmaterial is required for each load shipped.2: Reduced Ordering Costs\nYou can reduce the number of rolls required for your wrapping operations by\nusing specialised stretch film that travels two or three times the distance\n(yield) of standard stretch film. Further optimisation of the wrap\nconfiguration is possible due to the films amazing performance. This\nreduces purchasing costs, frees up valuable storage space, and reduces the\ntime spent replacing finished reels. In addition, fewer deliveries result\nin reduced transport costs, fuel usage and emissions.3: Maintain Quality\nReduced material use does not imply decreased quality. Specialist films\nhave a high durability and tension, ensuring the integrity and safety of\nthe pallet throughout its journey. This also improves the presentation of\nyour goods on the pallet, allowing for easy bar-code reading and a clear\nview of your primary products.4: Reduce Waiting Times\nPerforated films allow hot or moisture-laden products to cool or dry while\nbeing wrapped, eliminating the need for dedicated time and space in your\nbusy operations. ExcelAir can cut your cooling times by more than 50\npercent, saving you both time and money.5: Return on Investment\nWe understand that your primary revenue is dependent on your products. Our\nfilms have been designed to protect and preserve your shipments, with the\ngoal of minimising damage or spoilage of loads. This results in higher\nprofit margins on each consignment delivered.\"By embracing the latest technology in high performance films, you can\nreduce film usage by up to 70% and costs by 50%.\"6: Film Waste\nOur films have reinforced edging, which not only ensures a stronger wrap,\nbut also allows rolls to be dropped, thrown or run over and still unwind\nwithout issue, unlike standard films which will continue to tear. We\ncalculated that approximately 13% of standard pallet wrap is discarded\nwithout being used due to performance issues. This is something to think\nabout during the purchasing process.7: Staff Productivity\nEmployees who dislike using pallet wrap are common in fast-paced\nwarehousing and distribution. Standard films require far more effort to use\nbecause they are not flexible and cannot deal with protrusions, increasing\nthe risk of strain and injury. Unreliable film, which frequently tears and\nfails, can frustrate and reduce productivity, especially near the end of a\nshift. Goliath film requires far less effort and your employees will\nappreciate your investment in their tools.It is not a difficult or lengthy procedure.Goliath and ExcelAir films can be easily installed on existing machinery or\nintroduced for hand wrapping, with no extra effort!Contact us today at: info@excelerateltd.com and we will walk you through\nthe process; pallet wrap is all we do.\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "In this issue of Industrial Process News, we are pleased to announce Inchcape Shipping Services as our Maritime Services Provider Company of the Year.Established in 1847, Inchcape Shipping Services (Inchcape) is the result of a gradual evolvement of successful acquisitions and organic growth that developed it into a broad port agency network, helping customers to trade successfully and more efficiently in every port around the world. Today, Inchcape stands as one of the largest maritime services providers in the world. Headquartered in the UK it has over 260 offices in 60 countries and a team of over 2,700 professional and committed staff.Its worldwide infrastructure, extensive local knowledge and partnerships have enabled Inchcape to drive a positive change in the industry for 175 years. Inchcape offers a range of services orientating around delivering port calls that enable businesses to ship smoothly and trade successfully. As a leading local ships agent, its services cover everything from arranging crew changes, booking a slot in the port, arranging food and spares, to managing the process of customs and immigration so ships can come in and out of the jurisdiction. Given that 90% of everything we consume is delivered on a ship underlines the value and importance of these services in our current global economy. “It’s crucial that our services are provided in the most efficient, timely, safe and compliant way. Certain moments in history, such as COVID-19, the global supply chain disruption and the grounding in the Suez Canal prove time and time again just how important our services are as shipping is the lifeblood of the global economy,” said Chris Crookall, Chief Commercial Officer.Throughout its 175 years of history, Inchcape has delivered uncomplicated working solutions that are reliable, cost-effective, operationally efficient, operationally consistent, sustainably minded and compliant. As well as being in accordance with global government standards and local legislation, it strives to deliver a best-in-class service no matter where its customers vessels call from around the world.Inchcape also provide managed solutions for its customers, which are more colloquially referred to as ‘hub services.’ “A hub solution is where we not only provide the local agency service co-ordination, but where we manage outsourcing on behalf of ship owners or charters. Our services extend to some of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, as well as increasingly large traders and dry bulk companies who engage us as their potential hub agent meaning that we not only act as their agent in a local port, but we appoint the local agent on their behalf, be it Inchcape or another agency. We effectively become a global control centre for them, appointing agents to execute the port calls, ensuring service delivery KPIs are achieved, that disbursement accounts are correct and find ways to improve the customers profitability through vendor selection and strategic sourcing,” explained Chris. Since 2019, Inchcape has implemented operational changes to drive transparency across many areas. “There is an increasing need for transparency in the shipping agencies business, and we deliver this through our governance, compliance, and through our huge investment in technology. Our World of Ports and Optic systems enable our customers to see in real time everything that is happening in ports around the world related to not only their vessels but also the wider port eco system in general,” said Chris.In closing, we asked Chris, what makes the company unique in its field, he answered, “We are unique amongst the global agents in that we have a dedicated global strategic sourcing team whose prime focus is to manage and optimise the list of 7,000 plus vendors that we have around the world and make sure they fulfil strict compliance criteria but also fulfil cost optimisation and value criteria on behalf of our customers.”For more information, please see below:enquiries@iss-shipping.comwww.iss-shipping.com",

Its warehouse is a busy and complex environment that relies on many different devices and software to control operations, so it benefits from high-performance Cambium Wi-Fi from independent networking and Wi-Fi experts, Redway Networks. The Cambium cloud-managed solution provides reliable connectivity and communications from Pets Corner’s warehouse operations and distribution service to its 150 stores. Cambium Networks provides a fast, consistent Wi-Fi signal throughout Pets Corner’s warehouse to support automation and ensure the efficient flow of pet products in and out of the warehouse.Richard Smith, IT Infrastructure Manager at YourDMS and Project Manager for Pets Corner says, “Cambium maintains efficiency and accuracy in the warehouse and distribution facility and supports Pets Corner’s growing supply chain.”Redway Networks provided an end-to-end service“Our wireless project was complex as it was designed ‘off plan’ and we wanted to avoid typical warehouse Wi-Fi issues such as dropouts and patchy coverage. Redway Networks were flexible throughout the whole project and worked easily around construction issues. Redway also anticipated from the onset how the installation of the warehouse racks and electronics would impact the performance of the Wi-Fi and had the experience and insight to get the foundations right from the start.”Cambium supports fast-paced operations Redway Networks provided Pets Corner with a three-step delivery approach which included a predictive survey, installation, and post construction survey to ensure optimum wireless coverage and performance from its Cambium solution which includes cnPilot indoor and outdoor access points for automation and transparency in the warehouse, office and outside. The indoor access points were installed at each end of the warehouse isles with 30-degree directional antenna to ensure the signal is always strongest where needed. The outdoor access points connect the lorry bays and move stock straight to the warehouse shelves using Pets Corner’s fleet of auto-positioning forklift trucks (which are fully integrated with its stock control system). Omni-directional access points support mobile devices and access to warehousing software in the office.The Cambium wireless network is the foundation for all Pets Corner’s operations from stock into the warehouse to delivery out to its 150 stores, so having a robust, secure system that never loses signal has improved its supply chain.Richard says, “Pets Corner is benefitting from a seamless wireless communication network that supports all its warehousing and logistical operations. The Wi-Fi provides complete warehouse coverage for fast, accurate automated stock replenishment, which has improved efficiency. What we love about the Wi-Fi is that there is no difference in coverage when you walk around the warehouse and no drop-offs for the end user, which means the access point handover is seamless. The collaboration of Redway Networks and Cambium delivered on every front and I look forward to working with Redway Networks on future projects.”To find out how Redway Networks can help your business improve warehousing and logistics, please contact us on: 01908 046400, email: info@redwaynetwworks.com or visit: https://www.redwaynetworks.com/warehouse-wifiTo read the full Pets Corner case study, please check below: https://tinyurl.com/5xa3wt8p",

Inefficient warehouse practices can result in higher costs and\nreduced customer satisfaction. If your batch orders are too slow to keep up\nwith the demands of your booming eCommerce business or the time it takes to\ntrain up your new employees is excessive, you are losing time and money and\nyour WMS is probably to blame.With relentless eCommerce demand and tough customer expectations, keeping\nup isn’t simply a matter of ensuring you have stock, it’s a matter of\ngetting that stock out the door as quickly and efficiently as possible. If\nyour existing system can’t keep up with the demands of a fast-moving\nwarehouse, then it’s time you considered upgrading to the latest\ntechnology.Technology upgrades usually involve system downtime, expensive\nmodifications and lengthy training – not so with FulfillmentEdge from Zebra\nTechnologies. This WMS add-on will enhance your existing system and can be\nimplemented with minimal disruption.FulfillmentEdge’s dynamic workflows will allow you to pick up to 24% more\norders because your employees’ workflows will be contingent on their\nlocation, taking into account any task which can be performed in that\nlocality, and the priority of the incoming orders. So, instead of picking\none order at a time, your warehouse workers can pick multiple orders\nsimultaneously, and even put away any new items that have just arrived, all\nduring one single trip through the warehouse.With FulfillmentEdge, you can cut time spent on new staff training and\nonboarding significantly, saving you up to 90% of normal ‘bedding in’ costs\nby creating intuitive Android interfaces for your devices, replacing the\nclunky old green screen interface.If you’re using WiFi or RFID data collection methods, you can integrate\nthis information with your system to streamline your processes further.\nTake into account your employee locations, inventory levels and locations,\nand other warehouse assets, all at once. And, if you really want to\nmodernise your warehouse, add the latest technologies such as wearable\ntechnology. Head-mounted displays free up a worker’s hands, allowing them\nto navigate the warehouse and pick items without having to handle a device.Your current system may provide data on workplace productivity, but does it\ntell you exactly how each member of your team is performing?

      "DetailDescription" : "A number of factors, such as a need for additional space, decreasing staff\nlevels and an increase in ecommerce accelerated by COVID, are leading to\ncompanies reviewing their current warehouse operation and embracing\nautomated warehouse systems.\n\nTo meet the needs of this demanding and ever-changing market even more\neffectively, Quickline can introduce the Vertimag VLM, which provides\nefficient storage solutions whilst reducing the storage footprint,\nenhancing operator safety and increasing pick speed and accuracy.\n\nNot only does the Vertimag VLM system maximise storage capacity and manage\nchaotic flows, it also enables real-time and accurate inventory control,\nspeeds up preparation of orders and decreases errors. On top of this, the\nsystem also provides a range of benefits for the operator, such as a user-\nfriendly interface, an ergonomic picking bay to simplify picking and stock\nmanagement, and enhanced safety elements. All of these lead to an improved\nuser experience, which is further enhanced through a wide range of\naccessories to optimise working conditions, including a sliding console, a\ntrolley for tray removal, laser pointer, alphanumeric LED bar, barcode\nreader, piece counting scale and label printer.\n\nFurthermore, the Vertimag system can be supplied with Ergo-Tech, a Ferretto\nGroup exclusive. The Ergo-Tech system houses a second lift within the\nstructure which retrieves goods for the next pick â€“ all whilst the operator\nis completing the fulfilment from the first tray. The location of the Ergo-\nTech device within the structure makes it possible to occupy the same\nfootprint of a typical internal bay while allowing the flow of a double bay\nsystem, with greater flexibility in terms of storage capacity as the only\nlimitations on height is that of the warehouse. Because the system operates\nby lifting the second tray, the Ergo-Tech module allows the storage of\ngoods in different formats and sizes, with a product height of up to 400mm.\nThe systems safety features monitor the incoming goods to prevent any risks\nwhich may result from trying to store unsuitable items, whilst also\nscanning the height of the material to ensure the most suitable and\nconvenient storage location within the VLM.\n\nAdditionally, the Ergo-Tech system guarantees safety by ensuring the\noperator always performs the picking at the same ergonomic height, thus\nreducing the risk of potential injuries from unnecessary lifting or bending\nmovements. The picking bay is also equipped with safety barriers and an\nautomatic closing door, which operates when the vertical lift is in motion\nor when the system is not in use. The safety of the operator is guaranteed,\nthe goods are protected, and the noise in the work area is significantly\nreduced. LED lights also provide appropriate lighting during picking\noperations, especially when the lighting conditions are not optimal.\n\nAnother key benefit of the Vertimag VLM is the flexibility of its storage\nconfiguration. It is available in heights from 3 to 12 metres, with a\nmaximum capacity of 70,000kg and the ability to store goods of any format,\nweight and size up to a height of 695mm. In addition, the system can be\nsupplied in 15 models, 6 different types of picking bay (Ergo-Tech, single\ninternal, double internal, single external, double external, removable) and\n120 tray combinations making it a truly customisable system to meet your\npresent, and future, storage demands.\n\nThe Vertimag VLM is managed by software developed by Ferretto Group which\neasily integrates with corporate management systems. The management\nsoftware has been designed and tested for robustness and includes\nmaintenance algorithms to improve system uptime. To enhance its useability,\nthe system has a user friendly and customisable dashboard through which it\nis possible to quickly check the status of all the machines, dynamically\nmanage the compartments of the trays, and monitor in real time the stock\nlevels and the position of items in the trays.\n\nWith its countless operational benefits, the Vertimag VLM solution is one\nof the safest, most efficient and ergonomic picking systems on the market.\nIt benefits from 90% space optimisation to reduce the storage footprint and\noffers one of the widest range of tray combinations on the market. It\nprovides the ideal solution for the storage and management of goods,\nenabling businesses to improve workflow and warehouse efficiency, whilst\nproviding optimised space management.\n\nFor more information about the Vertimag VLM, visit:\nwww.quicklinestorage.co.uk\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Bradshaw has announce the launch of its all new state of the art The\nPT2500, a fully electric, remote-controlled, pedestrian-operated tow\ntractor designed for moving articulated lorry trailers up to 25 tonnes in\nmanufacturing and distribution applications.\n\nOverview\nThe PT2500 is a powerful, robust, high performance articulated trailer\nmover. It is easy to operate and moves trailers safely with exceptional\nmanoeuvrability, negating the need for terminal tractors. The high-\nperformance electric motors can tow up to 25 tonnes, and the hydraulically\npowered column lift can hoist up to 6,000kg. The remote-control\nfunctionality provides enhanced flexibility, manoeuvrability, and safety\nand optimally uses limited space. Simple to operate and low maintenance,\nthe PT2500 is an ideal partner for anyone working in logistics and\ndistribution.\n\nEnhanced visibility & manoeuvrability\nThe remote-controlled PT2500 allows trailers to be shunted safely and\nefficiently with no strain to the operator. Providing excellent visibility\nfrom any angle, the PT2500 and its remote control functionality let the\noperator walk around the trailer during manoeuvres, making them completely\nvisible and the ability to be their own banksman, all from a safe distance.\nConnecting the PT2500 to the fifth wheel is quick and easy, thanks to its\nprecise manoeuvring abilities.\n\nSpace-saving\nWith superior manoeuvrability, the PT2500 is ideal where space is a\npremium, presenting outstanding turning capabilities compared with terminal\ntractors. The PT2500 accesses tight spaces, turning almost on itself and\nallowing trailers to be parked tightly, thereby optimising limited space.\n\nRemote control\nControlled via the MLTX2 bellybox transmitter, the system incorporates the\nlatest electronic technology in a lightweight, comfortably contoured, and\ndurable case. Easy to use, the angled lever controls enhance operator\ncomfort. The remote-control housing is constructed from super-tough nylon\nto withstand shock, and the IP66-rated sealed unit can withstand harsh\nindustrial conditions.  Synthesised frequency generation enhances\nreliability for a robust and reliable signal. The access code system\nprovides peace of mind, as the signal only operates the intended equipment.\nDesigned to minimise power consumption, the NiMH battery packs provide\nlonger life between charges. The PT2500 remote comes with two battery\npacks, one for the remote control and a backup; both can be charged on the\nvehicle.\n\nBraking systems\nThe PT2500 features a built-in air compressor system to operate trailer\nbrakes utilising a dual-air brake system via the service and emergency air\nlines. When the tractor brakes are activated, the trailer service brakes\nare also activated and vice versa. The trailer mover features an e-stop; if\nthe e-stop on either vehicle or remote is activated, this will dump the\nair, activating the emergency trailer brakes. A speed limiter controlled\nvia a pressure sensor on the mast hydraulics activates when operating the\nfifth wheel, reducing the vehicle's speed during coupling. The vehicle also\nfeatures electronic regenerative braking under deceleration and dynamic\nspeed-sensing to prevent over speeding. An automatically applied\ntransmission parking brake ensures the vehicle remains stationary when not\nin use.\n\nFully electric\nThe robust and powerful high-performance trailer mover features an 80-volt\nAC controller, and the high-capacity 80v 210Ah lead-acid batteries provide\nhigh initial torque and smooth acceleration. Fully electric, the PT2500 is\na sustainable, environment-friendly, and cost-effective alternative to\ndiesel shunters. Producing zero emissions and no exhaust fumes, the\narticulated trailer mover can be used indoors for a healthier working\nenvironment. In addition, the PT2500 lorry tug is silent to operate, making\nnight and early morning operations possible, especially close to\nresidential areas. In the absence of a combustion engine and fewer moving\nmechanical parts, the PT2500 is straightforward and cost-effective to\nmaintain.\n\nCost efficiencies\nDeveloped for logistics and distribution, the PT2500 trailer mover has been\ndesigned to aid 24-hour operations. Negating the need for an HGV driver to\nbe on-site, the remote-controlled technology means articulated trailer\nmovement can be a one-person function. Anyone with operator training can\noperate the vehicle without an HGV licence.\n\nT 01780 782621\nenquiries@bradshawev.com\nwww.bradshawev.com\nwww.twitter.com/Bradshaw_EV\nwww.linkedin.com/company/bradshaw-electric-vehicles\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Meeting customer need during a pandemic is a situation most hope to never\nfind their business in. Add to that, the product was amongst those most in\ndemand and you have a perfect storm.\n\nSofidel Group has been operating for over 50 years and produces more than\none million tonnes of paper every year. It is one of the leading\nmanufacturers of paper for hygienic and domestic use worldwide (including\ntoilet paper and kitchen towels) and is well known for a number of its\nbrands - including Regina and Thirst Pockets. LPR has been working with\nSofidel for a number of years, to ensure that the supply of Sofidel\nproducts meets the demands of the marketplace.\n\nModern supply chains have to be run as very tight ships, with little room\nfor maneuver, however, that’s not to say that they lack flexibility or\nstruggle to cope with changes – particularly when they are well supported\nby partners who work to assist them in meeting need.\n\nAs we all saw, demand for household supplies and longlife staples increased\nexponentially hitting its peak during March this year. So, how do you\nsupport a business which sees volumes increase beyond those usually seen\nahead of Christmas peak – especially when there is no warning and the\nability to forecast becomes limited?\n\nWe started by working with Sofidel to review the current position, to\nunderstand what the best possible increased forecast could look like, and\nthen assessed the increases in activity we were seeing with our other\ncustomers in similar sectors. Once this was complete, both businesses\ncreated a forecast and looked to prepare their teams to respond.\n\nFor LPR, the first stop was to ensure that our systems were ready to cope\nwith the additional orders and to ensure that all parties were informed and\nready. The team at LPR prides itself on ‘doing what it takes’ to meet and\nexceed customer requirements and we were determined that this time would be\nno different.\n\nIndeed, the fact that the demand was led by something that could, and\nwould, affect everyone, meant that the teams were doubly determined.\n\nAlycia McQuillin, the Sofidel Strategic Account Manager at LPR was the\nfirst port of call when Sofidel were looking for assurance that LPR could\nmeet the likely demand, especially as it was expected that volume may more\nthan double.\n\nBy working with our Operations and Assets teams to consider current\ncapacity, Alycia was able to confidently assure Sofidel that we had\nsufficient pallet availability to support the anticipated demand.\n\nThe next step was to review the transport element of the service to ensure\nthat it would support the increases in volume. LPR has always worked in\npartnership with its haulage partners, and it was these relationships which\nenabled us to support Sofidel’s demand. Each and every delivery was met,\nloaded with pallets and ready for use, when and where they were needed.\n\nAlycia McQuillin, Strategic Account Manager at LPR comments “From the first\nannouncement of a pandemic, and the very first reports of bulk buying in\nthe supermarkets, we knew that things were about to get very serious. I\nknew then that I could rely on our team to support our customers, who were\nthemselves pulling out the stops to keep retailers stocked”.\n\nFrancesco Gilhardi -Country Logistics Manager at Sofidel said “What we\nneeded when the Covid-19 pandemic panic buying began was a partner that\nwould support us, and LPR did just that. Their understanding of our\nbusiness means that they were able to respond quickly and effectively.\nEvery order was fulfilled on time and in full.”\n\nPallet pooling is a circular process. Once pallets have been delivered,\nloaded and dispatched with our customers goods to their final destination,\nthey then need to be collected.\n\nSofidel uses LPR’s proprietary software, MyLPR; which means that we were\nable to efficiently collect the pallets from their final destination and\nreturn them to our depot, ready for their next use, ensuring continuation\nof supply to Sofidel and our other customers.\n\nContact\nwww.europoolgroup.com\n",

Even the entry-level model includes high-\nend specifications such as GPS, Wi-Fi smartphone connectivity and HD\nrecording - features that are unusual to find in such an affordable unit.\nHowever, none of the models require much in the way of windscreen real\nestate, and even less in terms of user input on a day-to-day basis. Once\nset-up, everything is designed to happen automatically. Recordings begin\nwhen the ignition is turned and continues recording throughout the journey.\nOnce the vehicle is parked, the G-sensor takes over and thanks to an in\nbuilt battery, If vibration is detected, the camera will begin recording to\nensure that your vehicle is protected even when you aren’t there. Video\nfiles are saved in 3 – 5 minute clips ensuring the latest events are always\ncaptured and ready to be viewed when necessary and they’ll even\nautomatically lock themselves to avoid deletion if the G-Sensor senses an\nimpact whilst recording. 24/7 Surveillance mode on the VREC-DZ600 and VREC-\nDZ700DC means that with connection to the vehicle battery (additional\naccessory) the camera will record round the clock recording anything and\neverything, day and night.\nEach camera's wide-angle lens offers a panoramic view, capturing objects\nand movement from even the periphery of the vehicle. Footage is captured in\n1080p resolution at a rate of 27.5 frames per second, while sophisticated\nimage correction widens the dynamic light range to compensate for contrasts\nbetween light and dark zones. The VREC-DZ600 and VREC-DZ700DC utilise the\nSony STARVIS sensor to ensure crystal clear night time footage so that you\nnever miss a detail!\nThe intelligent file management system will store video files logically\nwith driving recordings, parking recordings, write protected event\nrecordings and even still photos separately making it easy for the user to\nlocate any footage they need quickly. Once the memory card becomes full the\ncamera will automatically overwrite the oldest recordings ensuring that any\nprotected event recordings remain untouched. All recordings are overlaid\nwith GPS data, which offers important additional information such as\nvehicle position, speed, direction of travel and time.\nThe hands-free nature of Pioneer's dash camera range continues with the\ninclusion of built-in Wi-Fi smartphone connectivity.

      "DetailDescription" : "From the hugely successful Samson Nano pallet wrapping system, the Ferret was launched in 2018 by Samuel Grant Packaging. Developed as a solution to wrapping big or awkward pallets, as it drives around the pallet as opposed to requiring a turntable, the Ferret range has been restyled with added safety features. \n\nA footplate safety mat on the underside of the carriage has been installed to avoid foot crush, which Samuel Grant believe to be unique to the Ferret. Being the only mobile wrapper fitted with this feature, this new safety aspect demonstrates the innovative approach to H&S the company applies to its pallet wrapping range. \n\nThe new feature is part of the company's commitment to continually improve the safety of wrapping unstable loads to the EUMOS safety standard. The mobility of the Ferret mitigates risks involved in hand wrapping pallets as the machine can be taken to the load itself, removing the risk of unreliable load stability or staff injury.  The Ferret's magic eye can recognise the most unwieldy of shapes, to wrap allowing optimum stability during transport.\n\nThe Samson Nano won a Queen's Award for its unique pricing system and added safety attributes.

      "DetailDescription" : "Industrial Process News is pleased to announce as this issue’s Gas Transportation Company of the Month, Hexagon Composites. Hexagon Composites, a world leading provider of clean energy solutions, was established in Norway in the early 1990s by visionary Knut Flakk, and has been providing the Gas Industry with innovative gas storage and transportation solutions for nearly 30 years. The company has become known as a leading figure in developing and supplying more efficient products than those already on the market. The company is split into four business segments: Agility Fuel Solutions, Hexagon Purus, Hexagon Ragasco and Hexagon Mobile Pipeline®. Each segment brings its own team and ideas to the table, subsequently the Hexagon Group is capable of catering to a global market.\nHexagon offers safe and innovative solutions that adapt to meet a wide range of mobility and storage applications for compressed gases, in particular compressed natural gas (CNG), renewable natural gas (RNG), hydrogen and propane (LPG). With its headquarters is Aalesund, Norway and further facilities in Germany, Norway, USA, Canada and Russia, the company’s solutions are evidently renowned internationally. Hexagon is the world’s leading manufacturer of fibre composite lightweight components and systems, with over 500,000 high-pressure cylinders installed and more than 1,600 operating Hexagon Mobile Pipeline® units spanning more the 40 countries.\nA Mobile Pipeline® works in a relatively simple cycle: an empty container travels to its mother station where it is filled with natural gas. The full container then travels to an offloading station and is then offloaded at the client’s decompression station.  Being 70% lighter than the equivalent steel ones, Hexagon tanks allow to transport three times as much of gas. The carbon fiber composition makes the product stress and corrosion free; hence inspection is also less costly. The production units for Mobile Pipeline® are in Kassel, Germany and in Lincoln, Nebraska. While the first is specialized in building ADR (EU approved) and ISO 11349 containers (X-STORE®) with vertically arranged Type 4 cylinders, the second is manufacturer of long (40ft and 53ft) Type 4 tubes and related modules/trailers with American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) and American DOT approval (TITAN®). \nHexagon´s TITAN® solution offers the largest Type 4 cylinders available on the market, available from 30 ft up to 53ft. The cylinders can be offered in a trailer solution for ease of transportation. Along with the TITAN®, Hexagon Mobile Pipeline® offers the X-STORE® solution. Unlike the TITAN®’s horizontally assembled tanks, the X-STORE®’s tanks are assembled vertically, and are available from 10 ft up to 53 ft. Together, both strong brands have been distributed to North America, Latin America, Europe and Russia and Asia.\nThe company’s future plans are to expand even further than it already has. It aims to penetrate the Asian, African and Middle Eastern markets as well as stepping further into the hydrogen market. As well as broadening the markets it reaches, the company plans on broadening its product range to further develop as a systems supplier and keeping its focus on gas transportation.

      "DetailDescription" : "Industrial Process News is proud to announce that Palamatic Ltd has been chosen to receive our Materials Handling Company of the Year Award. For nearly 35 years, Palamatic has been at the forefront of innovation in the design and production of lifting and handling solutions for an extensive range of manufacturing industries. Since its inception, it has completed over 10,000 projects and is now active in over 50 countries, establishing itself as a global leader in materials and powder handling solutions.\n\nEstablished in 1985 by Stewart and Sue Bennison, Palamatic’s Headquarters are based in Chesterfield, with an additional American location in North Carolina. These are also complemented by a worldwide distribution network covering Africa, Europe, Asia, North America and South America.\n\nBoasting unparalleled expertise in all areas of handling solutions, Palamatic offers a wide range of equipment which includes vacuum tube lifting systems, support gantries, and automatic sack opening machinery. What’s more, Palamatic also offers cGMP hygienic handling systems under its PalPharma Handling Solutions brand, which are ideal for handling products within controlled environments, as well as keeping a stock of spare parts for standard systems.\n\nWe had the pleasure of speaking to Andrea Fincham, Business Performance Manager, who told us about Palamatic’s impressive achievements over the last year. The last 12 months have been extremely positive for Palamatic. Our sales figures have fared well against the targets set, and we have exhibited at eight trade shows taking place in the UK, USA and Europe. These covered all aspects of our product portfolio, which has generated an increase in brand awareness, labelling us as the go-to brand for materials handling solutions. We learn so much more about our customers from talking face to face, such as new handling issues, and this organically expands our solutions and understanding of the issues our customers face.\n\nThe past year has also witnessed some notable developments for some of Palamatic’s product ranges. We have undergone a standardisation project for our Uni-LITE range meaning that the product can now be sold as  a complete solution and rolled out to our distribution network. This is very exciting for Palamatic because the demand is high and we have a great product to supply.\n\nWe have also developed a new range of mobile handling units that are suitable for cleanroom environments and rated to IP65, which in real terms means the unit can be jet washed clean without compromising the internal battery and components. Furthermore, we have made developments to our cGMP pneumatic PalPharmAssist range for lifting weights up to one tonne.\n\nAs well as these advancements, Palamatic maintains its industry-leading standard equipment range for sack lifting, box lifting, drum lifting and pallet inspection. Its S-LINE vacuum tube lifter series is ideal for streamlined robust effortless lifting, perfect for cardboard box lifting and carton handling, palletising and depalletising. It is also designed for use with paper and plastic sack lifting and steel drum lifting. What’s more, Palamatic’s full range of pallet lifters and inspectors can cut down the time taken to load and offload commercial vehicles, offering speed and efficiency and reducing the risk of fatigue, injury or repetitive strain for the user.\n\nDetermined to remain as leaders in innovative solutions, Palamatic has been committed to advancing other essential areas of the company. We have been on an intensive recruitment drive, explained Andrea, covering roles throughout the whole organisation. We have also continued to invest in training, development, and our IT infrastructure.\n\nIn the present ambiguous climate surrounding Brexit and its possible repercussions, Palamatic is ensuring it remains steadfast in the face of these difficulties. It has been a period of steady growth amid the uncertainty of Brexit, so pushing forwards by positioning ourselves in front of our customers and developing new products has been a successful strategy for us. We have close relationships with Europe and our distribution network. Having spoken to many people, they do not appear fazed by Brexit but more interested in the difference it may make. We are obviously concerned about what may or may not lie ahead, but as a global company with strong partnerships in all continents, we are confident that we will embrace the challenges we may face.\n\nWe have found that our UK customers are less committed to raising the final system order, but are insistent that the projects are live. I think there has been a shift in mentality to mend and make do as we have found an increase in business from our existing customers to move existing systems and make upgrades to alter their use. When the country knows what is happening, we are confident that things will reset back to normal.\n\nWith a positive 12 months to build upon, Palamatic is constantly working on improving both its products and its brand image to further its impressive successes. In the short-term, we are pushing our standard ranges of products for vacuum lifting. Looking further ahead, we aim to grow the business and as best as possible standardise all of our solutions, endeavouring to be the go-to brand for materials handling solutions worldwide. We are also undergoing a lean manufacturing restructure of our production facilities and will soon be launching our new website.\n\nFinally, we asked Andrea about her thoughts on receiving our Company of the Year Award. We are very proud to be selected. We have been in business for almost 35 years and genuinely are experts in helping our customers solve their manual handling problems. Simply put, our solutions keep our customers’ operators safe and happy while improving productivity.\n\nPalamatic will be exhibiting at a wide selection of trade shows this year, including the AWFS Woodworking Show, Las Vegas in July; ISPE, Singapore in August; IMHX, UK in September; PPMA TOTAL show, UK in October; and the ISPE Europe Pharma 4.0 Conference in November.

      "DetailDescription" : "Industrial Process News is proud to announce that Palamatic Ltd has been selected as our Materials Handling Company of the Month, for their expert provision of materials handling solutions for an extensive range of manufacturing industries.\n\nPalamatic was established in 1985 by Stewart and Sue Bennison, who are still shareholders of the company, and their Head Quarters are based in Chesterfield. They also have American premises in Garner, North Carolina, as well as a global distribution network covering Africa, Europe, Asia, North America, South America, and Australia.\n\nAll of Palamatic’s equipment is bespoke to comply with each customer’s requirements, and they provide the service and commissioning for every product they distribute. Their range includes vacuum lifting systems, support gantries, and automatic sack opening machinery. Furthermore, Palamatic supply cGMP hygienic handling systems under their PalPharma Handling Solutions brand, which are ideal for handling products within controlled environments. \n\nThey distribute to any manufacturing industry where something needs lifting and transferring from one place to another, with their most frequent customers being involved in the food, chemical, pharmaceutical, and woodworking sectors. We spoke to Andrea Fincham about what makes Palamatic leaders in their field: “Our equipment is always designed with the operator in mind. Even a seemingly standard application will be looked at by an engineer to check it will work within the specific constraints of the process it is being used for.”\n\nIndeed, Palamatic are committed to providing excellent customer service, with a dedicated department providing after sales care and support throughout the lifespan of the customer’s handling equipment. The company also ensure they continue to travel the world to help maintain equipment, deliver training, offer advice on the latest products, and provide equipment refurbishment. \n\nIn addition to their distribution services, Palamatic also offer a Service Contract Plan, which ensures that lifting systems stay up to date and allows improved allocation of labour resources. It includes installations and commissioning, servicing of equipment, service response, spare parts and technical manuals, training, upgrades, and system relocations. The dates of these services can be arranged to suit the company’s production requirements, meaning Palamatic’s Service Contract Plan is more cost effective than a breakdown call out charge.\n\nOne of the keys to Palamatic’s success is their state of the art design studio, where design engineers use the latest 3D hardware and software, maintaining the same design philosophy whether they are working on core products or a customer’s bespoke equipment. Working with the customer and customer’s project teams, they ensure that the operational requirements, project deadlines and financial budgets are met, whether the client requires a unique solution or one from the shelf. As experts in health and safety legislation and ATEX regulations, Palamatic can guarantee that all their solutions are fully compliant, that legal obligations are met, and that their customer’s equipment and workforce are fully protected. \n\nIn 2017, Palamatic moved into a new factory, which is 22,000sq/ft. This huge expansion in factory space allowed them to scale up and provide a larger range of handling solutions for their clients. Indeed, they are currently in the process of introducing two new sub ranges, the Uni-LITE Series and Uni-LITE Flex Series. “The differentiator between the two sub-ranges is the strokes they can achieve to ensure the safest ergonomic application for the operator,” says Andrea. “Uni-LITE is for packing and unpacking applications around waist height and conveyor height. Whilst this range can offer longer strokes, we don’t see it as advisable to go for more than 600-700mm. The Uni-LITE Flex is for packing, unpacking, stacking, and de-palletising, and it has a much broader stroke range. It is also better for larger materials, where the operator prefers not to lean over.”\n\nThey are also introducing the new PalPharma Ally range of rechargeable IP65 stainless steel trolleys, which are electric and pneumatic and have a compact footprint. These will be used in the food and pharmaceutical sectors for transporting products, with various attachments for carrying, holding, lifting and pouring. There will also be options for spanning pallets so the user can pick and place on the pallet. Furthermore, they have developed a ground breaking platform system of PalPharma trolleys in partnership with Meissner filtration products, as part of the CryoVault™ project, which is a scalable, robust and completely single-use freeze and thaw platform for biopharmaceuticals.\n\nPalamatic also have expertise in supplying gantry systems. The optimised positioning of the supporting gantry or crane can be a vital element in the successful implementation of a new suspended load handling system. The transportation of load needs to be ergonomically managed in order to prevent unnecessary strain or physical stress for the operator. Palamatic ensures they design their lifting aids to match the task, and their crane systems to match the process environment, with the occupational health of the operator as one of their main concerns. Ergonomically, the lifting aid is only as good as the gantry from which it is suspended, and so Palamatic supply a complete range of overhead support systems which are individually rated for use with vacuum lifting units. These gantries are available in stainless steel, which minimises internal cavities and flat services to prevent product build-up and to aid clean down.\n\nAs the exhibition period approaches, Palamatic will be attending numerous trade shows, including Interphex in New York (2nd – 4th April) where they will be displaying their latest developments in pharmaceutical materials handling. They will also be at Powtech in Nuremberg (9th-11th April) at stand number 2-221, where they will be presenting the best of their handling equipment for the processing industries, including their new Uni-LITE handling range. You can also find them at ProPak South Africa, in Johannesburg, ProMat in Chicago, and Farmaforum in Spain.\n\nIf you would like to find out more information about how Palamatic can help your company, head to their website or use the contact details below.\n\nwww.palamatic.com\n01246 452 054\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Industrial Process News is proud to announce this month’s Intelligent Inventory Solutions Company of the Month as SupplyPoint for their innovative and market leading SupplyPoint point-of-use inventory management systems – changing the way inventory is managed in the workplace.\n\nFor over two decades SupplyPoint has established themselves as the world leaders in intelligent automated point-of-use inventory solutions; aimed at any industry or business where there’s a need to control the use of components, tools, stationary or anything required to operate.\n\nEstablished in 1998 by founder Jeff Harrington; their UK base of operations is located in Rugby where they have their research, development and manufacturing factory and head offices. With another manufacturing facility and office in North Carolina in the US and a further 6 offices located strategically in Italy, Germany, Brazil, China, Australia and India, SupplyPoint is a truly global brand.\n\nInventory Management Systems\n\nTheir secure storage solutions are built to dispense equipment of any kind to the end-user as required. From parts and tools, to medicines and stationary the applications are infinite and the direct benefits to the business plentiful.\n\nThe SupplyPoint point-of-use inventory management system logs users’ details each time an employee requests something - ensuring only the equipment, tools or parts needed are dispensed in the required quantity. This management of assets ensures accountability and automatically stops the misuse of equipment in the workplace – or theft.\n\nBy having all relevant tools and equipment in one area - positioned where needed – SupplyPoint solutions streamlines 5S in the workplace, increasing efficiencies. Employees have less opportunities to ‘waste’ time during working hours and internal studies with companies using the SupplyPoint systems have seen between 25% and 40% savings in efficiencies, while also seeing a huge drop in the misuse or ‘disappearance’ of equipment, tools etc.\n\nRemaining Relevant\n\nSupplyPoint understands that to continue to sell solutions to more clients their cabinets need to evolve with the times and adapt to customer feedback and suggestions – allowing SupplyPoint to stay relevant. Production of their solutions consists of three distinct areas as Mark Peers, President of SupplyPoint explains.\n\n“We research and develop all solutions in-house to ensure the highest quality and compatibility. We have large Design & Innovation teams dedicated to the hardware side of the cabinets, the electronics running throughout and the software solutions. Through close working relationships with our distributors and end users, our products are continuously evolving to provide ever improving benefits. Our custom design skills, coupled with a unique knowledge of real-life inventory management requirements enable us to produce products which consistently deliver diverse, tangible benefits to organisations of any size.”\n\nWhat stands SupplyPoint out from the competition as well as their industry leading software is the quality of the solutions supplied. Describing solutions as robust would be an injustice. During our interview Mark explained that many of their cabinets have been in continuous operation for over a decade. While most businesses prefer to supply newer, updated versions to clients on a regular basis, SupplyPoint pride themselves on the robust nature of their products.\n\n“Client satisfaction is crucial. We have distributed and installed over 38,000 supply solutions throughout the world and if they all last 20 years we’d be extremely happy. We value our reputation as a supplier of quality and robust solutions that can be relied upon. Our feeling is one of repeat and new custom through our status as the world’s market leader in our sector.”\n\nBringing Everything Together\n\nSupplyPoint’s latest solution – BinSenseTM – represents years of feedback and continuous development to create the first intelligent Kanban solution to be added to the SupplyPoint portfolio.\n\nDriven by a simple IoT controller and web based software, the system supports fast moving and low cost inventory through constant notification of inventory levels and automatic reordering resulting in the elimination of many of the manual replenishment steps associated with this type of inventory. To comply with visual manufacturing practices the BinSenseTM displays instant visual feedback through an innovative strip of LEDs.\n\nHighly configurable with 72 locations per frame, allowing 12 small, 8 medium or 6 large bin locations per shelf, the BinSenseTM solution can adapt to the specific needs of the user, and should things change, the solution can be adapted on the fly. And as with all SupplyPoint solutions, if required the system can be expanded to use multiple BinSenseTM systems all connected and configured to work in unison.\n\nTelephone: +44 (0)8445 761247\nEmail: uksales@supplypoint.com\nWebsite: www.supplypoint.com",

      "Description" : "Toolstream is the sole distributor of more than 6,000 branded hand tools, power tools, hardware & fixings, to retailers, wholesalers and merchants throughout Europe. ",
      "DetailDescription" : "Toolstream is the sole distributor of more than 6,000 branded hand tools, power tools, hardware & fixings, to retailers, wholesalers and merchants throughout Europe. Based in Yeovil, Somerset, the organisation operates from a purpose-built distribution centre and its philosophy of providing more than 6,000 tools ex-stock at low prices has earned the company an unrivalled industry reputation.\n\nMaking all tools available for immediate despatch and delivering transparency through the extensive use of the company’s web-based service, is key to Toolstream’s success and both are vital in keeping the organisation ahead of its many competitors.\n\nSince its incorporation in 2001, the business has experienced year-on-year growth as its product range is constantly being renewed, tested and extended to meet the needs of today's tool buyers and their customers. With storage space at a premium, growth, along with increased customer demand, forced Toolstream to review its operational requirements and to rethink its intralogistics strategy.\n\nIn 2015, SSI Schaefer undertook an analysis of Toolstream’s operation and devised a solution to satisfy the increasing demand for both storage space and faster order processing. Prior to this, picking was carried out using trolleys in very narrow aisle, adjustable pallet racking. While each trolley could accommodate up to ten orders simultaneously, pickers were walking in excess of 1.2km per order and trolleys would face queueing at packing benches, forming bottlenecks and thereby slowing down despatch.\n\nTo overcome both issues, SSI Schaefer enabled more efficient space utilisation by installing a series of vertical lift LogiMat machines in a purpose-built warehouse extension. With four banks of three and one bank of two, there were fourteen machines in total, occupying the entire length of one wall of the distribution centre, to a height of just over ten metres. \n\nThis installation significantly increased Toolstream’s storage capacity, providing over 10,000 bin locations for their medium and slower moving lines and as well as space efficiency, the main advantage is vastly improved picking efficiency. This is because as well as an effective storage system, the LogiMat is also essentially a goods-to-person picking system, improving picking accuracy and saving time by removing the need to walk and pick.\n\nTo further enhance the increased pick rate, a conveyor system was installed alongside, and parallel to, the ‘LogiMat wall’. The conveyors are fed by three carton-erector machines, bringing shipping cartons, automatically pre-labelled with unique, order-related barcodes and pick lists automatically inserted, to pickers working at the LogiMats. This means that system-directed cartons and totes can be diverted from the conveyor to the correct LogiMat zone, at which individual operators can scan their barcodes to determine what products need to be picked into them, before returning them to the conveyor for transport to the next zone.\n\nThe shipping cartons are completed with faster moving items picked manually from shelving on a two-tier mezzanine before the cartons are run through automatic sealing and despatch label machines prior to despatch. \n\nThe whole process represents a considerable saving on packing by picking into the automatically created shipping cartons and this has enabled Toolstream to reduce more than thirty pack benches down to only two. It has also removed the backlog of picked orders awaiting packing. The system also helps a great deal with small orders and the order rush created by the offer of free delivery on a Friday.\n\nThe solution from SSI Schaefer has given Toolstream the flexibility it needed to relieve pressure on, and improve, its distribution processes. The LogiMAT vertical lift storage system now plays a vital role in Toolstream’s operation, enabling the company to maintain its position at the forefront of the tool supply sector and positioning it strongly for further future growth.\n\nT 01264 386600\nwww.ssi-schaefer.com\n",

The company says this means the pallets last longer, need far fewer repairs and stay in circulation for longer than conventional non-protected pallets.\n\nThe protectors are based on the US pointGUARD invention, which UPALL has redesigned and developed for the European market. Tests on the protectors at Virginia Tech show that they increase the lifespan of a wooden pallet by three times, and potentially much longer. This is because UPALL protected pallets experience less damage with significantly fewer wood chippings and debris.

      "DetailDescription" : "Alcohol testing in the workplace in under 10 seconds\n\nIn this issue of Industrial Process News, we have selected AlcoDigital as our Drug, Alcohol & COVID-19 Testing Company of the Year.\n\nSince 2002, AlcoDigital has been one of the UK’s leading experts in Bio-Testing with a strong emphasis on alcohol and drugs, but since COVID-19, has expanded its bio-testing to include antigen, antibody, PCR and saliva based COVID-19 testing. With an aim to provide industry-leading testing equipment, training and servicing, AlcoDigital work with individuals, corporations and government organisations to find the right solution to their alcohol and drug testing needs.\n\nAlcoDigital’s clients come from a wide range of industries including transport, healthcare, construction, retail and government, and because of its rich history of expertise and knowledge in the field of bio-testing, many of its clients stay with the company for many years.\n\nProving a difficult period for a number of businesses all over the world, COVID-19 bought with it many downfalls that left some companies in a position to never recover from. AlcoDigital were able to side step its way through the pandemic, and despite its core customer base being left to face the brunt of the crises, Suzannah Robin, Operations Director of AlcoDigital explained to us how the company managed to turn a bad situation into a manageable solution.\n\n“We have over 20 years’ experience in this industry and therefore were able to transition our business objectives slightly. Because our suppliers who manufacture our drug testing kits also manufacture COVID-19 testing kits, it gave us a really good income stream when many other companies were really struggling. The last 12 months have been really positive for us because with COVID-19 restrictions now dramatically reduced, the main core of our clients are now back up and running meaning our alcohol and drug testing kits within the B2B markets has increased. Overall we have been very busy, and managing workload and employee sickness has been testing, but since summer 2021 we have exceeded sales putting us in a great position going forward.”\n\nWith recent additions to staff levels, AlcoDigital has been pushing their latest product - Worksober. Worksober is a fully automated alcohol screening system that identifies employees with facial recognition technology. It enables employees to be alcohol tested remotely in less than 10 seconds and can be used as a standalone breathalyser to screen employees before entering the workplace. Alternatively, it can be connected to entrance systems such as turnstiles and electronic doors to control entry to high-risk sites.\n\n“This was a system we launched pre COVID-19 but have been really pushing over the last 12 months. It is one of our key products and we are really keen for companies to take advantage of our trial offer to see how simple it is to integrate into the workplace. The unique selling point of the product is that it completely removes the manpower requirement out of alcohol testing in the workplace. It works solely by facial recognition and built-in RFID technology. Its fully automated with access entry and test data stored and uploaded to the cloud providing real-time system alerts via email or SMS when alcohol is detected. It has become extremely popular, and we’re really excited about it,” said Suzannah.\n\nThe Worksober can be mounted on a wall and used to automatically test your workforce on a daily or random basis. Being fully configurable, Worksober allows companies to test their entire workforce or just a small, select group. It is the most intelligent automated alcohol screening system available to the UK market to date. AlcoDigital will be showcasing this device at two events this year, alongside the device manufacturer:\n∙ ITT Hub 11-12 MAY 2022 Farnborough International\n∙ FORS in Manchester – 12 July 2022\n\nWith more than half a dozen companies now using two to three units each of Worksober, getting the knowledge of the product out into the market is the company’s main priority over the next 12 months. Its important to note companies can trial the product for free and if it works, then the benefits of the trail are that all the procedures and systems are already in place, and the monthly subscription takes care of the rest.\n\nAlongside the supply of products and servicing, the main core of the business is to provide CPD accredited face-to-face and online training for drug and alcohol testing through the AlcoDigital Academy. Available to individuals, organisations and governing bodies across the UK, the training is suitable for all levels of staff who provide support to your organisation when testing for drugs and alcohol in-house. Face to face ‘Workplace Training Days’ are available to everyone, running at over 30 locations across the UK. The online training courses offer convenience and flexibility whilst their bespoke on-site training is tailored to your company’s exact drug and alcohol policies.\n\nBeing able to offer such a unique product that is exclusive to the company, AlcoDigital will continue to push both Worksober whilst continuing its refresher training and introducing the training of and the Worksober product to new markets.\n\nSuzannah also mentioned another product that AlcoDigital is keen to support. “From 2025 new vehicles must have the hardware in place to support the fitting of an Interlock. Here in the UK there is no legislated requirement for these devices to be used to prevent drink-driving, therefore, we are supporting the action of this legislation to be approved here in the UK.” An alcohol ignition Interlock is a breathalyser immobiliser wired into the ignition system of the vehicle.  Marked as the most effective way to prevent accidents from drunk drivers, interlocks have the ability to eliminate repeat offenders, it’s just a case of making voices heard so that the UK government responds and takes action.\n\nIn closing, we asked Suzannah how she felt receiving the award, she commented. “We are very honoured. We are only a small company, yet our expertise and strong knowledge means we very much hold our own against big corporations. Our personal client relationships and strong leads enable us to provide our clients with the latest technology much quicker than larger companies. This award shows we are doing something right.”\n\nFor more information, see below.\n\nT 0208 454 7372\nwww.alcodigital.co.uk\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "UK filter manufacturer Amazon Filters has strengthened its SupaSpun and\nSupaGard meltblown filter range with the additional option of KilBac\ntechnology. Produced using a unique manufacturing process, the new SupaSpun\nKilBac® and SupaGard Kilbac® filters harness the latest innovations in high-\nperformance antimicrobial and antialgal additives.\n\nWith applications in water processing across many industry sectors,\nKilBac’s meltblown fibre construction is designed to prevent biofilm build-\nup on filters in both multi- and single-pass water systems. Crucially, the\nunderlying technology harnesses micron-sized particles containing active\nsilver, zinc and copper.\n\nCombined with a base polymer, the metals are incorporated in different\ncombinations to combat the growth of bacteria or algae on the filter.\nPrecise control of fibre diameters during manufacturing ensures that the\nmaximum area of antimicrobial material is exposed, which optimises\nperformance.\n\nThe launch follows a rigorous testing programme which demonstrated KilBac’s\neffectiveness against biofouling and the subsequent filter blockage or\nsloughing off of contaminants that can blind membrane systems downstream.\nKey to KilBac’s success is its ability to inhibit bacterial and algal\ngrowth by disrupting metabolic activity at cellular levels.\n\nIt is ideal for any application where potential biofouling of a water-based\nfiltration system can occur. Target industry sectors include building\nservices, power generation, chemicals and coatings, oil and gas,\npharmaceuticals and healthcare, and food and beverages.\n\nIn building services for example, filter life on sidestream installations\ncan be extended along with the potential to aid control of overall\nbioburden in the system. In oil and gas production, KilBac filters can be\nused to prevent premature blinding of SRP (single recognition particle)\nmembranes with algae.\n\nAmazon Filters Managing Director, Neil Pizzey, said, “KilBac is the latest\naddition to our solutions portfolio and is perfect for any process water\nsystem that is stop-start and so not in continual flow. In all kinds of\nwater-based recirculation processes there can be a persistent problem with\nmicrobial contamination and the subsequent biofouling of filters.\n\n“You find this in physical blockages of the filter as well as the sloughing-\noff of micro-organisms growing on the filtration media. The upshot is\ntypically an interruption to your manufacturing process and therefore\nincreased costs to put it right. In response, KilBac prevents biofilm build-\nup to avoid any interruption, extending the lifetimes of water systems and\nso reducing operating costs for our customers.”\n\nWhile both inhibit the growth of bacteria and algae, SupaSpun Kilbac is an\nabsolute depth filter while SupaGard Kilbac is a nominal depth filter. The\ndifference is that a nominal filter has broader manufacturing tolerances,\nso enabling greater variations in effective porosity.\n\nThe products look the same and have similar void volumes but they offer\ndifferent performance efficiencies. Customer choice will depend on specific\napplications, desired outcomes and budget.\n\nFor more detailed product information on SupaSpun KilBac and SupaGard\nKilBac, visit: www.amazonfilters.com/products/filter-cartridges-and-\ncapsules/kilbac-application-notes\n\nFor more information on Amazon Filters, visit: www.amazonfilters.com or\ncall 01276 670600.\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Established in the United Kingdom in 2003 IDEM Safety Switches are the UK’s largest machine safety switch manufacturer.\n\nContinually at the forefront of innovation within this market and in providing the 'Next Generation' of machine safety IDEM developed and introduced the SKORPION Trapped Key Interlocking with Key Exchange system in 2016.\n\nDesigned and manufactured in the United Kingdom, SKORPION has been developed to provide extremely robust mechanical coded key safeguarding and interlocking for hazardous machinery. All components of the system are available in Stainless Steel 316 or mirror polished die cast metal options.\n\nThe system works on the principle of releasing coded mechanical keys in a pre-determined sequence to ensure machine power is isolated before any access can be gained to hazardous or dangerous machinery.\n\nAfter the machine control has been isolated (first key turned in the system) the key from the isolator can then be used to release other trapped keys to enable access to the guarded areas.\n\nAfter release of the first key (power isolation) safeguarding can be achieved without the need for electrical wiring, this makes the system ideal for use in harsh environments. \n\nOperating Principle\nA trapped-key guarding system relies upon the transfer of keys between a power isolation switch (or control switch) and a locking mechanism fixed on a guard. \n\nThe essential feature of the system is that a removable key is trapped either in the guard lock, or in the power isolation switch. The interlock on the guard is arranged so that the key is trapped and can be released only when the guard has been closed and locked. This allows transfer of the key from the guard to the power isolation switch. \n\nClosing the switch traps the key, so that it cannot be removed while the isolator switch is in the ON position.\n\nIf there is more than one interlock then a key-exchange block is necessary, to which all keys have to be transferred and locked in before the access key, which is of a different coding, can be released for transfer to the other guard interlocks. Where there is more than one access guard, the key exchange block will accommodate an equivalent number of access keys.\n\nWhere a number of operations have to be carried out in a pre-determined sequence, then the transferable key is locked in and exchanged for a different one at each stage.\n\nThe SKORPION system offers the end user a wide range of system components and an infinite number of key codes to create their own bespoke system.\n\nRecent product introductions have expanded the system and now include the MX Key Exchange, more isolation options including solenoid control isolation switches and solenoid release interlocks with options for rear release escape.\n\nSKORPION can provide the end user with the solution to many interlocking applications where typical solutions are not available or create a configuration headache.\n\nAdvantages\n● No reduction of integrity due to the distance between movable guard and control system.\n● High mechanical integrity, robust fixings and holdings suitable for all types of guards.\n● Eliminates the need for electrical wiring to each movable guard.\n● Available in Stainless Steel 316 - making it suitable when the movable guard is placed in harsh or hostile environments.\n● Suitable for CIP and SIP cleaning processes and can be high pressure hosed with detergents at high temperatures.\n● Can be used where the movable guard requires to be removed completely.\n● All keys are coded in the factory and it is virtually impossible to override the system.\n● A trapped key system provides a quick yet safe and reliable access to machinery.\n● Use of a trapped key system can also prevent shortcuts and enforce a logical set of procedures that need to be satisfied.\n● Until the isolator key is returned to its original position within the lock, there is no way to enable the machinery to be re-started.\n\nIDEM Safety Switches are based in the North West of England and our machine safety switches which receive international recognition are shipped globally from the UK and from our USA base which services the North American market.\n\nWith huge investment in R&D and innovation we utilise the latest technologies to bring new switches to the safety market.\n\nSKORPION is part of an extensive range of machine safety switches and IDEM’s Stainless Steel 316 switches are IP69K rated and cope easily with high pressure, high temperature wash downs making them perfect for the rigorous demands of the food, beverage and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nWe are proud to manufacture in the United Kingdom and ensuring the safety of your personnel is important to us, you can be secure in the knowledge that every single IDEM product is manufactured, tested and approved to the latest safety standards.\n\nFor more information on the full range of IDEM machine safety switches please visit www.idemsafety.com or feel free to contact us on +44 (0)1942 257070.",

      "DetailDescription" : "Every day, more than 1 in 10 workers suffer from dermatitis – sore and inflamed skin on the hands which can make routine manual tasks a challenge.\n\nDermatitis is just one of a number of Occupational Skin Disorders (OSDs) which collectively pose a threat to health, safety and efficiency in the workplace, as well as to the mental, physical and social wellbeing of the individuals affected.\n\nDeb, the occupational hand hygiene and skin care specialists, is shining a light on the importance of the 3-Moments of Skin Care – a universal best practice standard for skin care which heralds a breakthrough in the fight against OSDs.\n\nhe recently launched whitepaper, ‘Preventing Occupational Skin Disorders: Skin Care Best Practice’, clearly re-affirms the 3-Moments of Skin Care as the industry standard for skin care and explains how businesses can adopt these three moments to improve skin behaviour compliance in the workplace.\n\nThe 3-Moments of Skin Care is the work of an expert panel of eight international dermatologists who have combined their wealth of experience and a comprehensive analysis of 75 published occupational skin care studies.\nThese three moments identify when skin care action is required, more importantly highlighting when skin protection or restorative creams should be applied by workers – before starting work, after washing hands (during work) and after finishing work.\n\nPaul Jakeway, Marketing Director at Deb, says, The whitepaper provides an in-depth insight into tackling Occupational Skin Disorders and how businesses can take the preventative steps to ensure skin care is front of mind.\n\nThe aim of the 3-Moments of Skin Care is to help occupational health and safety professionals develop a culture where skin health is considered a priority and where the wider workforce can understand, address and improve skin care behaviour compliance.\n\nThe ultimate objective is to reduce the incidence of OSDs and change workplace culture so that it is no longer deemed acceptable for workers to have to tolerate painful skin conditions. We believe the 3-Moments of Skin Care will form the catalyst for change in skin care behaviour.\n\nThe 3-Moments of Skin Care is implemented in the DebSafe™ skin care programme for industry, which aims to drive positive and sustainable behaviour change, increase skin care compliance, change workplace culture, and ultimately, ensure healthy skin remains a priority in the workplace.\n\nTo find out more, download the ‘Preventing Occupational Skin Disorders: Skin Care Best Practice’ whitepaper here: www.debgroup.com/uk/industrial/whitepaper",

Liverpool FC has placed one in its training ground at Melwood and one at Anfield stadium to make sure all players, non-playing staff and indeed supporters have peace of mind at all times.\n\nWhen giving manual CPR, minute changes in compressions have a significant impact on survival rates: even a minimal slowing down in the speed, or irregularity in compressions, will prevent oxygen from continuing to be effectively passed around the body. As the person giving CPR tires out, it is inevitable that compression depth, rate, and rhythm will slow and become less regular. A hands-free automatic CPR device like the Lifeline ARM takes away human fatigue from the situation, and therefore significantly improves survival rates.\n\nThe hands-free CPR device is part of the Defibtech critical Lifeline range of first aid products. It provides continuous CPR compressions, or works in conjunction with an automated external defibrillator (AED) for a shock-compression cycle. It is suitable for taking a patient from the site of collapse through to the hospital without interruption to the CPR cycle, which is much harder to do with manual CPR.",

      "DetailDescription" : "Watlow FLUENT® heater features dual voltage capabilitiesIndustrial heating technology manufacturer Watlow has upgraded its FLUENT®\nheater, which now features dual voltage capabilities. The lightweight, high-\nperformance solution reduces overall system cost and complexity of heating\nin semiconductor, medical and analytical industries.Watlow’s FLUENT heater is a high watt density, low mass heater that enables\non demand fluid heating with an ultra-fast response, leading to higher\nsystem performance. The standard construction includes an internal baffle\nto promote turbulent flow and high efficiency, a fast-responding high watt\ndensity layered heater circuit, low profile axial lead exit and an internal\nthermocouple for high limit control.Now, the popular heater has been upgraded with dual voltage capability,\nwhich allows heating products to accept more than one type of voltage. In\ntraditional thermal systems, a unique design was required for each voltage\nto support global demand. But with a dual voltage FLUENT heater, one design\ncan deliver the same wattage level on both 120V and 240V systems.This means the same heater can now be used in different regions to quickly\nand accurately heat liquids or gases as a single, integrated solution.The FLUENT heater is an in-line heating system, meaning engineers can\neasily integrate the heater by connecting tubing to the FLUENT’s inlet and\noutlet. “In-line helps to save installation time compared to a traditional\nimmersion heating solution and eliminates additional components — reducing\noverall system cost and complexity,” said Andy Selvy, chief system designer\nat Watlow.“Other heating technologies require more components and therefore added\nweight and complexity, increasing the risk of breakdowns and more frequent\nmaintenance intervals. The compact nature of the FLUENT heater means the\nsize and complexity of the heating system is decreased, without\ncompromising on efficiency, performance or control. In fact, its smaller\nsize reduces overall component weight by up to 95%, compared to both\ntraditional circulation heaters and cast-in heaters.”Running 240V wiring or installing step-down transformers to select\nlocations can be a costly renovation project, and depending on a facility’s\nneeds, this may also be time-consuming. “Instead, installing a heater with\ndual voltage capabilities can prevent costly facility upgrades, and\nprovides original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and design engineers with\nthe versatile heating solutions they require, helping to streamline\nefficiency,” continued Selvy.In addition, the FLUENT heater is powered by Watlow’s patented thermal\nspray technology, which makes use of its entire surface to produce heat,\ndelivering consistent and reliable thermal energy when required. “Despite\nthe compact size of this in-line heater, it is capable of delivering heat\nwith improved temperature uniformity across its entire surface, optimising\nheat transfer,” explained Selvy.“The FLUENT heater allows engineers to take charge of the full power\ndistribution to deliver repeatable, customisable and precise heating\nprofiles. There isn’t anything else like this on the market.”Watlow offers standard size FLUENT heaters ranging from 250 to 8,000 watts,\nwith several designs available for quick delivery.

      "DetailDescription" : "Industrial Process News is proud to announce that Unitive Design & Analysis has been selected as our Imaging & Sensing Company of the Month. Founded by Phil Marsden in January 2014, the company was initially a one-person consultancy, and has since expanded to include four full-time employees, along with an extensive network of contractors and subject matter experts.\n\nBased in Hackney, London, Unitive Design & Analysis delivers technical services based on the philosophy of marrying together all of the technical output requirements with the market needs - its internal and its clients’ design teams working together to produce a solid, reliable and regulation-compliant product. 'We work across the board,' Phil Marsden explained. 'We do our best to satisfy everything the user requires, and our services are highly versatile.'\n\nIndeed, the range of projects on which Unitive Design & Analysis has worked is extensive. The company’s clients spread across the SME and large enterprise spectrum, and it has worked with multi-nationals so that they can try out new designs without distracting from their standard product development. Unitive Design & Analysis also often works with start-ups, who lack the resources and knowledge to bring products into a regulated market. Boasting a team of experts with diverse backgrounds, Unitive Design & Analysis has the capabilities to provide these start-ups with the resources and experience they need in a highly flexible way. The company also frequently works with universities, helping them to translate emerging technologies into products.\n\n'Fundamentally, we are happy to work with anyone who is serious about bringing a good product to market,' Phil explained. 'Much of what we deliver has to comply with European and US regulations. We spend a lot of our time ensuring that our designs and the wider teams’ designs comply with these regulations. We often work at the systems level with the product and project management functions in our clients’ companies to ensure that designs are fit for purpose. This takes us into the realms of verifying the usability of the product from a technical perspective and, in some cases, end user validation.'\n\n'We are, however, certainly not limited to systems level engineering. My team designs high speed/low noise electronics, complex optical systems, infrared imagers, radiation detectors, hyperspectral imagers, spectrometers, laser control systems, precision monitoring systems, and motor control assemblies. We are a bunch of engineers and scientists who design technology for demanding and complex environments.'\n\nAlong with this admirable versatility, it is Unitive Design & Analysis’ dedicated and distinctive approach which sets them apart. When engaging with a new client, the team always works from the perspective of the market, even if the client has a solution already in progress. Phil elaborated, 'We start from the use case/user requirements, through the requirements for compliance and market viability, and then we look at the technology. We are happy to design the whole thing from top to bottom, but we will design it making sure that we can verify performance, validate the product in the use case scenario, and design it to get the Regulators’ approval from the get go.'\n\nThe last five years have seen impressive growth for Unitive Design & Analysis, and in 2019 it moved to its current location in Hackney. Here, the company was able to lay an ESD-safe floor, and build a dedicated lab to safely work with sensitive electronic devices, high voltages, ionising radiation, and optical radiation. Furthermore, with further growth highly likely, this new space gives the company room to expand over the next few years. Certainly, there is no doubt that Unitive Design & Analysis is establishing itself as a highly capable and versatile company, placing it in an enviable position as it continues to develop.

      "DetailDescription" : "Operational Efficiency\nWe all know that the calibration of instrumentation used in regulatory control is mandatory – the introduction of ISO9001 made this very clear for any company using the standard as the basis of their Quality Processes. Whilst ISO9001 has been revised, the task facing an instrumentation technician today is changing. In the past it was acceptable to calibrate every instrument on the plant annually when there were sufficient staff to calibrate 10 to 20 instruments every day. Now OE task teams are rightly asking questions such as, can we make the instrumentation tasks more efficient, can we change the calibration intervals based on the risk of failure or inaccurate readings – can we do more with less staff?\n\nLet’s just look at the variety of tasks being performed by instrumentation on an asset. There is the day to day operations of the plant, the pressure, temperatures, flows and levels associated with wellheads, separators, compressors, injection systems etc. Then there are the fiscal measurements - those skids that result in tax being paid – so typically specialist flow rigs that measure the quantity and quality of oil and gas being shipped off a platform or received at an onshore plant. Traditionally the task of calibrating fiscal and process instruments has been performed by two completely separate teams – often separate contractors and to date this appears to be continuing.\n\nProof Testing - New tasks for busy Instrument Techs?\nJust recently I have been asked by a number of platform operations engineers about the Proof Testing of Safety Instrumented Systems. Safety Systems are increasingly becoming totally integrated with their associated Process Control Systems – although there is typically separate hardware and instrumentation, the user interface is similar or even the same. The SIS is designed to ensure a process goes to a safe condition in the event of a critical event that could lead to an unsafe condition or even\n\na catastrophic event, such as an explosion or an uncontrolled pollution event. ISO61511 is used to define the design, installation, operation (and decommissioning) of safety systems, but in practical terms this means that instrumentation engineers are legally required to test the operation of the safety systems loops and record the information, making it available for inspection by a government agency such as the Health & Safety Executive. In many respects it’s very similar to the regulations faced by instrumentation engineers in the pharmaceutical industry, where the emphasis is on electronic signatures, the competence of staff and integrity of data.\n\nIn terms of instrumentation, the Proof Testing tasks are very similar to a typical calibration, but the key difference is in the frequency of the testing. Earlier in this blog I referred to the risk-based approach to calibrating instruments and yes, having an instrument calibrated on its due date is desirable, but not exactly critical. (Heresy I hear you cry!). With an SIS Proof Test, it’s the exact opposite – the test intervals will very likely vary from loop to loop. Each loop is designed to meet a particular Safety Integrity Level determined by the possible effect of a critical failure. Each element of the loop, each instrument, valve and switch will have been designed and manufactured to meet the required SIL – but here’s the rub – it all depends on the Proof Testing interval of the instrument as defined in the safety manual. So an instrument from vendor A will meet for example SIL2, but requires to be tested annually, but another apparently similar instrument from vendor B (hidden in the small print of the safety manual) may require testing every three months in order to meet its Safety Integrity Level, and often loops are designed to have similar instruments from different vendors remove any systemic failure modes.\n\nAnd while you’re at it…\nWhilst IEC 61511 applies to safety instrumented systems, there is also the task of the inspection and testing of all the C&I infrastructure in hazardous areas. The regular inspection of Ex rated switches, junction boxes, safety showers etc. is now covered by IEC6007917. Again, the emphasis is on the legal requirement – not just to perform the inspections but to be able to prove the inspections have been carried out. Often the inspections are visual only to record the condition of the item and raise a corrective work order if necessary.\n\nIt doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see the similarities in the requirements of all these various calibrations, proof tests and inspections; so the question is, can we take the multiple standard operating procedures documents, put them in an electronic form that we can carry around the platform and efficiently perform the tasks, recording the results and transfer them back to SAP or similar.\n\nAn Excel spreadsheet is no longer sufficient…\nWhilst the majority of Oil and Gas customers are currently using separate teams or contractors to perform these tasks, you can see why several companies are ‘rationalising’ the workforce – making fewer technicians perform more and varied tasks. It makes a great deal of sense if they can use the same tools, hardware and software, to not only perform calibrations, maintenance checks and proof tests, but probably more importantly from an operations point of view, to have the resulting records readily available and traceable.\n\nT 01455 821920\nwww.beamex.com",

      "DetailDescription" : "Industrial Process News is proud to announce that CMC has received our Company of the Year Award for the development of AIRMATICS™, an innovative cloud-based air compressor monitoring, performance and control solution that provides real time data, analytics and insights at the push of a button.\n\n'We’re honoured to have won the award and delighted that our commitment to innovation has been recognised,' said Graham Coats, Sales Director. 'We now look forward to building on this recognition and the interest we’ve received in AIRMATICS™ by developing the product and making it even more accessible to the widest spectrum of manufacturers.'\n\nAIRMATICS™ is capable of managing an infinite number of locally interconnected fixed speed, variable speed or variable output air compressors by responding to feedback in real-time and automatically adjusting settings and performance levels accordingly.\n\n'It has been met with huge interest by manufacturers across multiple sectors that are looking to improve the performance of their compressors and reduce their energy bills. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that AIRMATICS™ has the potential to revolutionise the manufacturing industry and we’re incredibly excited to be the first company to have created a truly brand agnostic solution that can be used to support any compressor of any age. Simply put, AIRMATICS™ enables even the oldest compressors to become smart compressors.'\n\nIndeed, the last 12 months have been an exciting time for CMC, with sales across the company’s wider product portfolio remaining high. What’s more, interest levels in AIRMATICS™ have been overwhelming. 'We expect to convert a high number of leads over the next quarter. However, while IoT-based products and solutions are ubiquitous in other B2B sectors and, of course, the consumer marketplace, there is still some way to go before IoT in the context of air compressors becomes the norm.\n\n'We’ve launched AIRMATICS™ at a time when the industry is still at a crossroads between old thinking and new thinking. Once new thinking is widely adopted and the potential of IoT in a manufacturing setting is fully embraced, then I expect AIRMATICS™ to become CMC’s flagship product in a very short period of time.'\n\nCertainly, against the backdrop of escalating energy prices, it is pertinent that AIRMATICS™ is Industry 4.0 ready. 'This means that via automation, interconnectivity and data exchange, it adds value by providing users with real-time data about the health and performance of all air compressors – from one standalone compressor to entire networks of compressors. Furthermore, when the AIRMATICS™ COMMAND & CONTROL platform is utilised, air compressor performance can be remotely adjusted to increase efficiency and reduce energy usage – and the associated carbon footprint. Through CMC’s in-house R&D team, we’ve established that AIRMATICS™ can reduce manufacturers’ compressor related energy costs by up to 30%.'\n\nOne of the key advantages of AIRMATICS™ is its ease of use and refreshing simplicity. 'We’re applying IoT technology to the world of air compressors in a way that’s very simple to use and, through a visual interface, easy to understand, which means that data that may have been hard to comprehend – or would at least require significant manual number crunching to make sense of it – can now be summarised and communicated in seconds. This provides full visibility of air compressor performance in a way that just hasn’t been available – until now.\n\n'With AIRMATICS™, we not only want to simplify the process of compressed air performance monitoring and management, we also want to provide customers, be they factory owners, facilities managers or distributors, with an Industry 4.0 solution that enables 360° visibility of an air compressor network at any given time and from anywhere. AIRMATICS™ takes air compressor performance monitoring and management into the 21st century by providing users with real time intelligence on their entire compressor assets’ performance and health, all while creating efficiencies and reducing air compressor wear and tear.'\n\nIf you would like to find out more information, head to the website or get in touch using the contact details below.\n\nT +32 (0) 552 37090 \nsupport@airmatics.eu\nwww.airmatics.eu",

      "DetailDescription" : "Regular calibration of low pressure transmitters is a requirement of systems controlling clean rooms throughout the pharmaceutical industry. As the sensors are often remote from the control system and its user interfaces this has usually required two people to carry out the work. One would generate the pressure manually at the transmitter, whilst in contact with a second person, via radio. The two operators would call out the values as they were attained and held. The person at the control panel would then make whatever adjustments were necessary and make the notes. The issue with this approach is that keeping the pressure constant is a challenge when looking at such a small value. It is not just a case of closing the valve on the calibrator, the pressure needs to be adjusted and chased by the technician.\n\nThe ADT 760 LLP provides a completely automated solution for this application. Using the touch screen interface the technician can programme the 760 to run the test cycle with dwell times between points. When the unit is running the tech can just walk over to the control panel and note the points, make adjustments as needed. The second technician can be getting on with another set of calibrations.\n\nThe ADT 760 can also be communicated with wirelessly to generate different points, start and stop the task etc. The 760 comes with a built-in pressure module to 75 mbar and provides an accuracy of 0.05%FS . Additional internal pressure modules (ADT155 series) are available and provide a variety of ranges down to ±0.62 mbar. The accuracy of 0.05%FS and control stability 0.005%FS is based on the internal module’s span.\n\nMeasurements can be made in gauge or differential mode.

In electro-motors, the use of a temperature signal side in a speed sensor requires significantly more adaptation as the installation position has very different ambient conditions from the common installation position of the temperature sensor. \n\nThe indisputable advantage of being able to call up several parameters at the same time is still actual. The cost advantages are complex and are not only limited to the installation costs, but also do not include requiring further sensor access gates.\nThe advantages are obvious:\n• Material costs: one complete sensor with its own electronics, own housing and connection interface are saved. \n• Installation effort: complete elimination of one installation process\n•  Design simplification: Saving an additional sensor access including all possible side effects like improving design freedom and reducing leakage opportunity. \n\nWolfgang Sexauer, Sales Manager: at first glance, the idea is captivating and logical, as is every good idea. However, as usual, we can certainly say that the problem was in the detail. Especially when considering the realization of the series product, many challenges had to be overcome. But now the products are available, and sales are developing above our expectations. We are sure further series will follow.\n\nwww.rheintacho.com\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Industrial Process News is happy to present Northern Balance with our coveted Laboratory Equipment Company of the Month profile. Northern Balance are industry leading, weighing specialists, providing unbiased advice, quality equipment and excellent support to businesses across the UK since 1971. \nDecember 2016 saw Northern Balance become part of the Gem Scientific Group, which includes Gem Scientific, a laboratory equipment and consumables supplier, Precision Instruments, an ISO accredited weighing and legal verification specialist, and Yorkshire Scientific Instruments who specialise in on-site servicing of microscopes, temperature and precision weighing equipment. \nThe partnership between the companies is part of their ambitious development plan to service the growing life sciences, food and beverage, pharmaceutical, education, manufacturing and medical technology sectors across the UK and Ireland, while improving product and service offerings for all clients and enhancing their local and national presence whilst continuing excellent customer service across the group.\nPrecision Instruments and Yorkshire Scientific Instruments are now integrated into Northern Balance, allowing them to offer a full range of services through one company. \nA UKAS accredited calibration laboratory (No. 0370), Northern Balance have maintained this status for 26 consecutive years and are one of the few companies to attain this high standard for on-site calibration of non-automatic weighing machines. \n2018 has seen Northern Balance exceed their UKAS status, adding ISO 9001:2015 accreditation and NAWI D Certification (certification for module D of Directive 2014/31/EU on Non-Automatic Weighing Instruments) to their organisation. NAWI D Certification allows Northern Balance to perform Legal Verifications and Re-Verifications of weighing instruments in the same way that Trading Standards do, adding another service offering to their service portfolio.\nThe combination of these three accreditations makes Northern Balances one of the few UK weighing companies to achieve this standard, and reflects the competence, impartiality and integrity of their business, assuring clients they will always receive the highest quality of service.\nSam Jones, technical and quality director for Northern Balance said, “Merging the quality processes and legal documentation of Northern Balance and Precision Instrument has been an intensive process, but thanks to the hard work and commitment from our team we have achieved these certifications. ISO 9001:2015 is a standard that all companies will know, and that organisations of all sizes strive to achieve, and will ensure the future success of Northern Balance.”\nAs an industry leader in the weighing field, Northern Balance is continuously looking to challenge and improve themselves and work closely with various accreditation bodies, equipment manufacturers and undertake regular training to keep their product knowledge and technical abilities up to date. In conjunction with Newcastle College and the UK Weighing Federation, they are developing the new metrology apprenticeship.\nDaniel Egan-Sheath, Group Finance and Operations Director said, “The framework for the apprenticeship will train the next generation of engineers and technicians into their industry, and ensure that we don’t just have the best employees now but have the next generation of engineers to drive and continue the hard work already put in over the last 40 years.”\nNorthern Balance relocated in 2017 to a new facility on the Team Valley Trading Estate, with a fully equipped workshop for their engineers and a showroom for them to exhibit the latest in weighing technology for clients. The second base of operations was set up in 2018 at the Gem Scientific offices near Leeds, with a third in Hull opening early 2019.\nTo support their continued growth, February 2018 saw Northern Balance launch a new website to highlight their extensive service and product offerings, along with unleashing a new fleet of vehicles across the North of England. With their eye-catching design, they are sure to turn heads. \nAs one of the UK’s leading independent distributors of weighing equipment, they work with some of the worlds most trusted brands. Because of these strong relationships, Northern Balance is well placed to supply state of the art weighing equipment to businesses countrywide. \nMoving into 2019, Northern Balance are developing their Industrial Division, providing turn-key solutions for businesses looking at large scale weighing and inspection, including weighbridges, silo and vat weighing, x-ray and metal detection equipment.\nJustin Welton, Managing Director of Gem Scientific and Northern Balance, said, 'As the Gem Scientific Group continues to grow, this is a great opportunity for all the companies to employ their respective expertise and substantially enhances the Group’s ability to provide the latest technology to companies across the UK.\n“We’re honoured to be recognised as Industrial Process News’s Company of the Month in recognition of our status as one of the UK’s leading independent Weighing specialists.

      "DetailDescription" : "Incredible, isn’t it? That in this age of technological achievement there are still many bakers who continue to use the inaccurate, time-consuming, and inefficient ‘bucket of water’ method.\n\nAdding water to a mix has long been carried out using pails or hosepipes - a labour intensive operation that is wide open to accident and operator error. However, a Hertfordshire company looks set to change all that.\n\nJohn Morton manufactures the Abacus Aquameter. The digital, micro-controlled device delivers exact, pre-selected quantities of water from a single pipe - straight into the mixing vessel. This precise metering of the water means the operator can exactly re-create batch consistency each time.\n\nInstallation of the unit is straightforward, taking less than thirty minutes to complete. From there, operation of the meter is simplicity itself: the quantity of water required is keyed in, the ‘start’ button pushed, and the water flows. A water solenoid valve located in the water pipe closes the flow at the completion of the cycle - when the pre-set batch quantity has been reached.\n\nA range of accessories is also available, allowing control of water temperature and water filtration.\n\nMatt Bell, Production Manager with Bell Bakers, located near Glasgow, says of the system, “We use two systems for metering water into the mixers in the main bakery area and one into the boiling pans for stews. Were it not for these units we would be using buckets of water or a line of hose - not that convenient.” He goes on, “We have control over the whole operation... it’s obviously more accurate than relying on staff to put it in by pail.”\n\nBakers now have the ability to reproduce exact batch consistency each and every time... And that can be no bad thing.\n\nFor further information about the Abacus Automatic Water Dispensing System, contact John Morton on 01992 442861.\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Building on unique technology, the Vaisala Optimus™ DGA Monitor for Transformers solves many current problems in transformer maintenance.\n\nPower transformers are critical in the energy generation and transmission, but also one of the key vulnerabilities. This is because any transformer downtime will lead to substantial financial losses and to energy shortfalls for national grids. Repairs and replacements can take months, greatly increasing associated business interruption costs.\n\nEfficient condition monitoring is one of the only means of proactively mitigating the risk of transformer downtime. Furthermore, real-time monitoring of the dissolved gas content in transformer insulation oil allows a utility to diagnose any emerging faults quickly and reliably, and plan their maintenance activities better.\n\n“Approximately 50% of power transformer faults can be detected with the right online monitoring tools, meaning that severe failures can be prevented. But nobody wants monitors that give false alarms or require regular maintenance. So we created a product that does not,” says Product Manager Juhani Lehto at Vaisala Controlled Environment.\n\nThanks to its careful design and the patented technology, the Vaisala Optimus™ DGA Monitor for Transformers does not give false alarms. It carries an IR sensor based on Vaisala core measurement technology and components manufactured in our in-house cleanroom. It uses vacuum gas extraction, which gives a fully representative sample and means no data fluctuation due to oil temperature, pressure, or type.

      "Description" : "“We were established in 2009 as OCIP ENERGY Ltd,” explained Aidan Brown, Managing Director",
      "DetailDescription" : "“We were established in 2009 as OCIP ENERGY Ltd,” explained Aidan Brown,\nManaging Director. “As we approached our 10th anniversary, and with the\nacceptance of LED lighting into the mainstream market, we changed our name\nto LED Industrial Lighting Company Ltd to better reflect the nature of the\nmarket in which we operate.”\n\nBased in Cheltenham, LED Industrial Lighting Company Ltd operates across\nthe UK and Europe, and numerous key clients have used its services across\ntheir European operations. As the status of LED lighting has changed, so\nthe company has adapted its services to better address the needs of the\nmarketplace. “The company’s role has evolved as LEDs have become more\naccepted,” explained Aidan. “In the early days, it was about convincing\nbusinesses that LED was the future. Nowadays, we are effectively a\nspecifier, assisting clients to identify and source the most appropriate\nproduct for their premises.”\n\nWorking exclusively with LED lighting, the company has a focus on the\ncommercial and heavy industrial markets, including hazardous area\nenvironments, as well as significant experience in the niche market for\nobstruction lighting.\n\nWith the increase in LED lighting’s popularity, there has undoubtedly been\nan increase in the number of poor quality products, which have swamped the\nmarket and made it increasingly difficult to find the best and most\nsuitable solution. Thankfully, LED Industrial Lighting Company Ltd’s\nextensive experience of the LED lighting sector allows it to match the most\nappropriate fittings to the client’s requirements, as well as guiding\nclients to the right products for their individual requirements, without\nmaking expensive mistakes.\n\nCertainly, LED Industrial Lighting Company Ltd has a documented history of\nlistening to the market and addressing its needs, something which is\nreflected in the company’s motto to ‘listen and deliver’. “We believe in\nunderstanding the client’s operational requirements and then developing a\nvalue proposition that addresses those needs, all within budget,” Aidan\nelaborated.\n\nOf course, LED lighting is constantly evolving, but there are limitations\nas to where future efficiencies will be generated in the LED technology\nalone. “Where the real revolution is occurring is in the controls for these\nlights,” explained Aidan. “LED Industrial Lighting Company Ltd is able to\noffer the market leading remote monitoring platform, which allows a user to\nmonitor and manage their lighting infrastructure from their own laptop,\ngiving real-time data on what is happening within their office, building or\nentire estate. We can monitor a suite of parameters from energy usage to\nthe status of the batteries in the emergency fittings. This offers\npotentially huge maintenance savings, and the system will automatically run\ntest and report systems to ensure full regulatory compliance.”\n\nWith an outstanding reputation for quality, value and customer service,\nthere is no doubt that the future looks bright for LED Industrial Lighting\nCompany Ltd, a company which clearly possesses the drive and determination\nto continue its innovative work. “2019 was a challenging year for us as a\nbusiness. Specifically, I was diagnosed with cancer in March and underwent\nchemotherapy for the best part of a year. During that time, I continued to\nwork and am very grateful for the support of our existing clients, as well\nas the patience of the new ones. Having had the all-clear at the end of\n2019, I am keen to drive the business forward and make up for lost time.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more information, head to the website or get\nin touch using the contact details below.\n\nT 01242 250633\ninfo@ledindustriallighting.co.uk\nwww.ledindustriallighting.co.uk\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Alfa Power is delighted to announce that they have been awarded the award for ‘Best EV Charge Point Operator 2019’ from SME News.\n\nThe company, which celebrates its 2nd anniversary in November 2019, launched the UK’s first public 60kW charger in 2018. At that time, it was the fastest charger open to the public. A few months later Alfa broke its own record by launching the UK’s first 100kW charger, unmatched by any other operator. This charger received an upgrade about a month later to bring it to 120kW, breaking another record which stood for well over a year.\n\nSME News’ ‘Best EV Charge Point Operator 2019’ is a new award for 2019, and Alfa Power fought off stiff competition to win. \n\nFiras Al Fadhili, Head of Group Alfa, said, “Being at the forefront of the EV charging industry over the last 2 years has put us in the driving seat for innovation, breaking down what people perceived to be possible with the 60kW and the 100kW chargers. We are an EV charge point operator set up by EV drivers for EV drivers, which we believe gives us a competitive edge.”\n\nOver the next few months the company will start to roll out a cutting-edge 25kW DC wallbox. In tests, the wallbox showed little to no drop off in charge rate, and only came out 7 minutes slower to charge a car fully than a 50kW rapid. \n\n'Alfa Power will continue to push the boundaries of the industry and provide widespread solutions to help more drivers to make the EV switch,” continued Firas. “Watch this space for continued exciting innovations!”\n\nSME News has been awarding small and medium enterprises for the last 4 years. The accolade for ‘Best Charge Point Operator 2019’ was part of the Energy and Power awards, the first year this has been run.\n\nhttp://alfapower.co.uk",

      "DetailDescription" : "Powersolve’s new PSICL series is a low-cost peak inrush current limiter designed for capacitive and inductive loads in a variety of applications. these include installations across complex automation systems and machinery as well as isolation transformers or LED lighting applications where they are particularly useful because you can have a large number of LED driver power supplies operating in parallel and all taking high peak currents together on switch on. \n\nThe PSICL series is a true current limiter and cuts off all peak currents when starting loads under practically every AC condition. Extreme conditions can occur on AC lines in the event of a break in the supply and when power returns, high current peaks can often cause havoc and will trip circuit breakers. In decentralised areas, this will often lead to increased maintenance costs as the breakers require re-setting. The PSICL current limiter prevents this happening and can result in reduced cable cross section used and smaller and faster circuit breakers. \n\nThe PSICL series is available in three 230VAC single phase models with continuous operating current rating of 12A, 16A and 25A. Current limiting time is 100-500mS repeat intervals of 1000mS. They have an operating temperature range of -40°C to +70°C and conform to EN60950-1 and EN61000-6-20-3 standards and are CE and RoHS. MTBF figures are 300,000 hours. \n\nThe PSICL is housed in a low profile V0 flammability rated plastic case measuring 91H x 71W x 57Dmm. The same design designated PSESB series is also available in a very slim width enclosure with measurements of 100H x 22.5W x 112Dmm. Both items are DIN Rail mounted and internal circuitry is identical for both versions.\n\nwww.powersolve.co.uk/product-category/inrush-current-limiters/",

      "DetailDescription" : "Industrial Process News is happy to announce as its Electronics Company of the Month, Powersolve Electronics Ltd, for its contribution to the electronic industries.\n\nIn September 1987, Peter Clark established Powersolve Electronics Ltd. The business is now part of the multinational UK listed XP Power PLC Group, and has office and warehouse facilities in Newbury, Berkshire, as well as offices in Taipei, Taiwan and parent company manufacturing facilities in China and Vietnam.\n\nPowersolve is a supplier of just about every type of power conversion equipment, including but not limited to AC-DC Converters, DC-DC Converters, DC-AC Inverters, Uninterruptable Power Supplies, Programmable Power Supplies, External Power Adaptors, Battery Chargers, Lithium Batteries, Lead Acid Batteries and USB Charging and Sync Hubs. Peter Clark tells us that 'I would say that we probably have one of the broadest power product ranges available from one single supply and the expertise to help the customer choose the right product for their requirements.'\n\nThe company supplies to a broad spectrum of sectors, including telecoms, datacoms, industrial, oil and gas industries, mobiles communication and LED lighting. However, any company that is involved in the production and manufacturing of electrical equipment that finds itself in need of voltage conversion solutions could benefit from Powersolve’s products and expertise.\n\nOver the last seven to eight years, the company has applied a large focus on Lithium Batteries and their chargers. Peter Clark adds 'In recent years we have had some success with Lithium Battery Chargers and Lithium Battery Packs for a variety of customers manufacturing portable electronic equipment for one type or another.' Peter continues 'we have many power supplies installed into variable message signs on motorways, in cellular radio systems used by the emergency services, small PABX systems, control equipment in power stations, uninterruptable power supplies on oil rigs, in airports and in medical equipment. The list is vast.'\n\nThe business keeps itself involved with customers while equipment design processes are underway in order to provide the most cost effective solution, as opposed to simply offering a product asked for. If Powersolve does not stock a desired product, the company guarantees searching its global network for it, or where possible designing a customised solution. Despite competing in an irrefutably competitive market, Powersolve maintains its position as a leading figure, priding itself on over 30 years of experience in serving the various industries that benefit from the products it provides.\n\nT 01635 521858\nwww.powersolve.co.uk",

      "DetailDescription" : "New DIN Rail AC inrush current limiter for capacitive & inductive loads\n\nPowersolve’s new PSICL series is a low-cost peak inrush current limiter designed for capacitive and inductive loads in a variety of applications. These include installations across complex automation systems and machinery as well as isolation transformers or LED lighting applications where they are particularly useful because you can have a large number of LED driver power supplies operating in parallel and all taking high peak currents together on switch on.\n\nThe PSICL series is a true current limiter and cuts off all peak currents when starting loads under practically every AC condition. Extreme conditions can occur on AC lines in the event of a break in the supply and when power returns, high current peaks can often cause havoc and will trip circuit breakers. In decentralised areas, this will often lead to increased maintenance costs as the breakers require re-setting. The PSICL current limiter prevents this happening and can result in reduced cable cross section used and smaller and faster circuit breakers.\n\nThe PSICL Series is available in three 230VAC single phase models with continuous operating current rating of 12A, 16A and 25A. Current limiting time is 100-500mS with repeat intervals of 1,000mS.\n\nhttps://powersolve.co.uk/product-category/inrush-current-limiters\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Paul Hooper, display group manager and Rhett Evans, embedded sales manager at andersDX, investigate the pitfalls for display and board integration, and how to avoid them\n\nNo one supplier offers both a board and a display that meets your requirements. Is it an issue to source these components from two different suppliers? How difficult is the integration process? Low cost boards like Raspberry Pi or Arduino seem to offer most of the features you need – can’t you just use one of these? Can you run up a quick demonstration of an idea on them without going through the whole integration process? These are questions that we hear a lot, so let’s explore these issues.\n\nThe integration process\n\nThe answer is that you don’t have to source both components from one supplier – but integration tends to be easier and quicker if you do. Let’s flesh that out a bit. The integration process isn’t something to be feared. There is normally a solution to be found. Equally, it shouldn’t be underestimated. It usually takes at least two weeks to get a board up and running with a display unless someone has prepared the ground.\n\nIf you specify two components from the same supplier, they may well already have integrated these for another customer. If not, they may well have worked on a similar project. They will be aware of some of the potential issues and challenges, and can provide a fast path through. If there are bugs or anomalies, they can recreate the pairing in the lab and work on a solution. If the supplier has never seen the board, or the display before, they’re starting from a blank sheet of paper. Often, they are dependent on the co-operation of the other supplier to resolve any issues that may arise.\n\nThe emergence of platforms like Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Beaglebone should gladden the heart of engineers everywhere. Countless outstanding electronics engineers got their start by tinkering in school and university labs – and these boards allow that fine tradition to continue. They are cheap, flexible and allow endless opportunities for creativity. The features, capabilities and performance offered by these platforms at the price are exceptional and it isn’t surprising that the cry, “Just use a Raspberry Pi, and you’re almost done” is often heard. The devil is in that word almost, because there is no end of potential hidden costs.\n\nAll of the issues with integration discussed above apply in this case too – though they can be harder to address as essentially you’re left to rely on the community rather than the supplier for support on the board. Although Pi and Arduino come with standard interfaces, as with any platform, it is essential to check how easy it will be to interface the platform to the target display. Does the board run at the same voltage as other system components or will an extra power supply be needed?\n\nThere are other issues too though. A major concern is longevity of supply and support. It is well known that Pi is based on a Broadcom processor that isn’t commercially available, and all these platforms are sole-sourced. The manufacturers can amend or discontinue their product at any time to address shifts in their bread and butter markets, leaving you high and dry.\n\nA further point to bear in mind is that your competitors can buy a Raspberry Pi or Arduino as easily as you can. Unless you’re adding something genuinely innovative and hard to replicate, you are providing an easy path for others to copy your solution. If time to market and predictable, long term availability are a concern to you, leaves these platforms to hobbyists and students, and develop using platforms that long term will cost you a great deal less.\n\nSome customers use Raspberry Pi, Arduino and similar boards to produce low cost, proof of concept prototypes, etc – but even here the invisible costs are often greater than the benefits. You will still need to go through a lot of the integration process to pair the board up with a display, and are then faced with going it through again when you start development in earnest using different hardware.\n\nIf you need to build a proof of concept, look for platforms available specifically designed for this purpose. A pre-integrated display and board pair like the DX family from andersDX work together out of the box – all you need to do is load your software. Usually, you can select a platform with a processor, operating system and display close to the components that you envisage for the finished design. Platforms like the DX family come with the most popular operating systems in images for displays from 4.3” to 15.6”.\n\nHaving gained acceptance for the project from stakeholders like management, marketin, customers and/or investors, you can, if necessary, take the time needed to get a specific board working with a specific display for the production product. Often, though, we find customers are able to adapt the prototype platform to create the finished production design to get to market with the minimum of time and cost.\n\nDo you need to source both the display and the embedded board or SOM from one supplier? The answer is that if you have your heart set on a particular board, the suppliers should work with you to integrate that board with that display. To keep development time and cost to a minimum though it is better to specify a pair of components that your suppliers know can easily be made to work together – or better still, a pair that they have already integrated and supply working out of the box.\n\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Belgium-based CMC features as this month’s Company of the Month. We spoke with the firm’s Sales Director, Graham Coats, following the launch of its AIRMATICSTM range to find out his plans to innovate the air compressor market.\n\nSince opening its doors in 1985, CMC has carved an international reputation for designing air compressor controls without compromise and that add value to manufacturers that incorporate them. \n\nIts approach to producing robust, multi-functional control solutions from its Belgium-based facility has seen the business evolve into a multinational firm with a presence in China, USA, France, Turkey and the UK.\n\n'Our aim is to add value to air compressors around the world by producing control solutions that increase the lifespan and performance of our customers’ air compressor assets, boost productivity, reduce operational costs and decrease carbon footprint,' explains Graham. \n\nIs the launch of AIRMATICSTM an extension of this philosophy? \n'Absolutely', continues Graham. 'AIRMATICS™ is a simple cloud-based air compressor monitoring, performance and control solution that provides real time data, analytics and insights at the push of a button and can reduce compressor-related energy consumption by up to 30 per cent. It’s also Industry 4.0 ready, which means that via automation, interconnectivity and data exchange, it provides real-time data about the health and performance of all air compressors – from one standalone compressor to entire networks of compressors, regardless of the compressors’ brand.'\n\nAside from reducing energy bills by up to 30 per cent and helping plants to minimise their carbon footprint, AIRMATICS™ also reduces wear and tear of each and every asset by ensuring that performance never exceeds system requirements at any given moment. It also decentralises decision-making by automatically making the best decision for a plant’s air compressor system and reduces time spent manually on issue diagnostics and resolution. \n\nGraham expects this latest offering from CMC to cement the firm’s position as an industry innovator, a message it took to this year’s industrial technology exhibition, Hannover Messe.\n\n'The response so far has been incredible. Companies are responding really well to what AIRMATICSTM stands for, particularly the fact that it’s brand agnostic and can be used with any compressor of any era. It’s a very exciting time for the company and a period in CMC’s evolution that I expect will lead to significant growth over the next two years.'\n\nHowever, it is not just AIRMATICSTM that is driving CMC’s growth. The second half of CMC’s flagship product range, AIRMASTERTM, which focuses on manufacturing embedded air compressor controls for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), is also going from strength to strength. \n\nIts latest generation of AIRMASTER™ FIT has been developed in response to growing demand for CMC-built products that have the ability to optimise air compressor performance, support economical and environmental efficiencies and boost manufacturers’ productivity.\n\nWhen asked about CMC’s growing portfolio, Graham concluded: 'With AIRMASTER™ FIT, we want to provide OEMs with added value without the added cost and help them to use CMC’s proprietary functionality as a way in which to secure additional on-going revenues with existing customers. This, combined with the fact that we’ve designed in features commonly sought by OEMs in wider geographical areas, such as the Asia-Pacific markets, means that the business is well-placed for growth in regions where CMC has, until now, had a relatively small footprint.'\n\nIt is clear that the business, which is now over three decades old, shows no sign of slowing down. With a raft of innovative compressed air control, performance and monitoring solutions on the horizon, it looks like we can expect to see more from CMC as manufacturers continue to seek out solutions that deliver high outputs and add value against the backdrop of shrinking budgets.",

High-performing mechanics within the smallest possible installation space, plus easy power transmission, an extended service life cycle and a positive price-performance ratio are the stand-out features of this new series.\nThe leg length in the most compact of the new angular gears is shorter than a matchstick. Ketterer offers seven sizes, featuring legs from 32 to 60 mm long. The angular gear meets many needs in installation, assembly and automation engineering. Further potential areas of application include shading and building engineering, as well as mechanical engineering.\nIn principle, the gear can be used for any deflection of a linear movement as well as being ideally suited to swivel motions. The applicable areas of deployment in plant construction or handling systems particularly include driving conveyor belts, adjusting the width of conveyor belts or swivel arms as well as adjusting positioning units and pallet systems. The Ket-Bee 200X is used in shading technology applications to adjust slats and other shading elements.\n“The need for compact dimensions meant we had to use appropriate materials and prioritize the gear teeth quality. Accordingly, even the most compact model, with a leg length of 32 mm x 32 mm can guarantee maximum torque' - Ketterer CEO Odin Jäger.\nThe quality of the Ket-Bee 200X is reflected in its long service life and high power density. One reason for this is the use of top-quality materials. The angular gears comprise surface-hardened steel bevel gears and top-quality ball bearings for input and output drive. All of which makes them ideal to withstand the high stresses imposed by mechanical engineering. The precision-manufactured steel bevel gears have a radial clearance of just 3° ± 1°. This means the gear operates virtually noiselessly as well as being low-wear and maintenance-free. The gear ratio is 1 for all versions: 1, with torques and a power spectrum – depending on size – ranging from 0.1 to 10.0 Nm.\n\nT 01623 655265\nwww.sdproducts.co.uk\n",

      "Description" : "As manufacturers within the automotive industry strive to meet the challenges of a highly competitive global marketplace – particularly within the realms of fuel efficiency and environmental impact – the die casting industry is undergoing a period of change and development.",
      "DetailDescription" : "As manufacturers within the automotive industry strive to meet the challenges of a highly competitive global marketplace – particularly within the realms of fuel efficiency and environmental impact – the die casting industry is undergoing a period of change and development. Time Butler at Ultraseal International discusses these trends and how Lubrolene water-free die-release technology can bring about significant quality, cost, productivity and environmental benefits for manufacturers.\n\nIn recent years we’ve seen a shift towards lightweighting in the automotive industry with increasing use of aluminium for powertrain components and a rapid growth in aluminium structural components such as shock towers, rails and torque boxes. In fact, structural casting is now being adopted in higher volume, mid-sized vehicle platforms that need to be manufactured to a consistent quality in multiple global locations.\n\nFundamental in delivering that functionality is the process of die-casting. Supporting manufacturers to move away from multi-component welded assemblies for vehicle structures, high pressure vacuum die-casting technology is able to provide a complex, one-piece structural component, significantly reducing the assembly, number and weight of components in a vehicle. In practice, substituting traditionally steel components with lightweight, one-piece structures contributes significantly to reduced vehicle weights. That means greater efficiency, reduced fuel consumption and lower levels of CO2 emissions – all key focuses for automotive manufacturers as legislation around the world places greater emphasis on fuel efficiency, emission and the environmental impact of vehicles.\n\nFurther to this, lightweight structures, and the weight reduction associated, are essential for the increasing adoption of electrified vehicles. A segment of the market forecast to grow strongly in the medium, major OEMs are investing significantly to develop the necessary technology cost-effectively.\n\nDevelopments in die-casting technology have facilitated the design of larger, more complex, structural components which assist the automotive industry with its weight reduction goals. This approach accommodates larger components such as door and window frames, instrument panels and cross members to be produced by die-casting, and has led to a trend toward larger die-casting machines and increasing shot weights.\n\nHowever, the complexity of large one-piece components makes it difficult to design internal cooling which successfully reduces the temperature of all parts of the die uniformly. This can lead to localised hot spots and solder problems.\n\nOvercoming Challenges\n\nTo avoid compromising quality and increasing costs in the creation of large, complex components, specifying the correct die-casting lubricant is essential to ensure an adequate release lubricant film is formed over the die surface. However, the surface temperature of the die makes this difficult with water-based lubricants. To ensure the oil film is successfully formed on the die surface some water-based lubricant will remain in the die cavities. This may cause porosity problems and water stain on the casting surface. While residual water on the die surface can be dried using compressed air, this extends cycle times and is a costly consumer of electrical energy, increasing processing costs.\n\nFor an industry looking to cast larger components with higher process temperatures and also meet the challenges of maintaining product quality, improving productivity and reducing costs, Lubrolene WFR provides the best solution. Significantly reducing the quantities of lubricant required, Lubrolene negates the need for die cooling by lubricant and delivers a high adhesion efficiency for thicker and more effective film formation.  Quality is improved through better molten metal flow and reduction of the quantity of trapped gases due to no external water-cool, as well as the fact that WFR can be applied at higher temperatures than conventional water-based lubricants, meaning there is less thermal stress on dies. The avoidance of heat cracks extends the service life of the dies significantly – the major source of savings.\n\nWith cavities increasingly present in complex pieces, Lubrolene WFR-EC – which features an electrostatic charge – ensures an effective and efficient release. Creating a wrap-around effect, the electrostatic charge delivers consistent, uniform coverage, irrespective of die complexity. Using a specially developed electrostatic spray gun, the application of Lubrolene WFR further reduces soldering problems, providing full, unrivalled coverage. Once the practicalities of complex, one-piece die casting are resolved through the implementation of new technologies and solutions, the benefits for automotive manufacturers begin to emerge fully.\n\nReduced spray time, increased die life and a low reject rate all lead to enhanced benefits and cost savings for manufacturers. Combine that with zero wastewater from the process and reduced CO2 emissions, as a result of reduced air blow, and the environmental impacts of utilising an efficient casting die release lubricant cannot be ignored.\n\nT 024 7625 8444\nwww.ultraseal-impregnation.com",

NMS are regarded as a leading Innovative Metrology Company that specialise in providing world-class Automated Metrology Solutions, through their use of ground-breaking Inline Measurement technology.\n\nNMS have developed an innovative Autoscan system that is pioneering in its ability to measure Body in White (BIW) Cars in process with up to 200 features on a vehicle in less than 55 seconds, with a precision of a tenth of a millimetre. This is exceptionally beneficial for clients as it can save on production time, alongside offering clients reliable and honest data that they can trust. The system has been heralded for its high-precision and accuracy, which is comparable to a Dual Arm CMM, meaning that offline CMM correlation is not required and therefore offering immediate actionable information to production engineers.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that NMS’s Industrial Robot Measuring System utilises Leica T-Scan High Speed Scanners that are tracked by Leica Absolute Trackers, providing up to 210,000 points per second, which for the volume of a vehicle sets a benchmark for industrial shop floor measurements. The Absolute Trackers have an inbuilt Laser Interferometry and Absolute Distance meters with High Precision Angle Encoders that allow the accuracy of the system to be wholly independent from the Robot. \n\nAdditionally, NMS’s Automate Software controls the evaluation of results, in conjunction with the robotic cell measurement process, which is adapted to fit individual customer specifications. Unlike their competitors, NMS are proud to manage the measuring process, connecting devices, robots, PLC, safety components and the measurement process with PolyWorks inspector software.\n\nIn addition to the precision and repeatability, NMS’s Autoscan Inspection Systems offer absolute measurements by being able to measure the car’s reference points automatically. This means that every car has an alignment to its specific geometry rather than other systems who only offer relative measurements and are dependent upon the robot’s accuracy and repeatability.\n\nIn a recent interview with NMS’s Vice President of Sales & Marketing, Steve Shickell, we asked Steve whether the company had changed its focus over the last couple of years. Steve told us that the company have shifted their prime focus to the support of manufacturing that optimises production processes through in-process quality control. This has been applied through the company’s range of consultancy services, where NMS experts are pleased to consult with clients to discuss every aspect of automated metrology solution. This has been introduced to allow NMS to deliver turnkey solutions with their own dedicated team of experts. \n\nWe also asked Steve if the company have any plans for expansion or development. He told us that the company is about to expand its operations in Germany and South Europe and would also be expanding its range of products to include Digital Factory Simulation Software, which will allow users to easily build layouts, modify component parameters and simulate an individual factory environment. This will be in conjunction with rebranding from Non-Contact Measurement Systems to New Manufacturing Solutions which will be announced on the 17th September.\n\nIf you would like to get in touch with NMS, call them on the number listed below.

Our aftermarket team can globally support the product in the field, from spares and service right through to upgrades or retrofit solutions for both surface and subsea products all engineered and produced at our UK Brighouse site which boasts full design and manufacture and world class Machine, assembly, Service and R&D facilities. We can also offer Cradle to Grave care and support of our product,” said Stuart.The company offers an invaluable number of services from servicing and maintenance, diagnostics, overhaul and repairs, upgrades and spares, and asset life extension. Its highly skilled aftermarket engineers can create technical engineered solutions that benefits not only the valve, but the efficiency of the whole application. “Our products can be found in almost every major oil and gas producing region and are used across a wide range of applications, including the petrochemical, power and utilities industries globally. We have always prided ourselves on the quality of our product and the performance it provides linked to a high level of application / product knowledge that our sales and application engineers have. We have a broad range of solutions that we can utilise in our control and choke valves that mean the selected valve is the optimum solution rather than a close compromise forced by mass production limitations,” stated Stuart.With the effects of COVID-19 still looming, Stuart described how the last 12 months has fared for the company, “We continued to trade during lockdown as we are an essential supplier to the energy sector, so we had as many staff as possible working from home with machine and assembly shop and support staff at the office all operating under social distance and limited movement policies. One of the biggest challenges was managing the effect on the supply chain both UK and internationally as various countries were affected. Some of the systems and practices we adopted during lockdown have had a permanent effect on our working day. Tools such as Teams and virtual whiteboard / update meetings have greatly improved our efficiency.”Financially, COVID-19 has had some dramatic effects on businesses all around the world. Stuart explained how the company has adapted to these changes. “The last financial year ending March 2021 was a strong year for KKI on shipments despite all the challenges COVID-19 presented and we finished on target with a strong order book for the coming year. However, bookings were slow for the back half of the year and the first half of the new financial year as part of the carryover from COVID-19 uncertainty and lockdowns. The slow recovery was in line with our forecast, and we predicted a hockey stick profile to bookings favoured towards the third and fourth quarters as the projects we typically target would start to move ahead.”Recently, the company has been shifting into transition energy. Energy transition refers to the global energy sector’s shift from fossil-based systems of energy production and consumption to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar as well as lithium-ion batteries. “Transition energy has been one of the most recent developments. In practice the transition energy market place is fast evolving and new players are appearing almost daily. The challenge is to stay relevant and current with our products, but we are confident we are well positioned to meet the needs of the various sectors of transition / clean energy like CCUS, offshore electrification, offshore wind and hydrogen both blue and green. We’ve already seen a step change in the number of enquiries and requests for support in the Transition Energy sector and orders for one of the leading CCUS projects in the Norwegian sector,” stated Stuart.In the future the company will continue to support its customer base as well as supporting its global installed base with spares, service and new replacement equipment and upgrades. In the long term, it will continue to strengthen its product offering in the transition energy segment and invest heavily in Additive Manufacturing technology with a view to reduce lead times, material waste, CO2 emissions and develop new and novel designs and solutions only possible with AM technology.In closing Stuart added, “Change is nothing new to KOSO Kent Introl who through our 54 years have seen us supporting the emerging UK North Sea market and the burgeoning UK Petro chemical sector. Since we have broadened into global offshore oil and gas developments, midstream and downstream global projects, as well as the power segment and combined cycle gas turbines. We will be there to develop, support and adapt to the future worlds process control challenges. Many of the skill sets and products we have are transferable in meeting future energy needs, for instance we provided our first hydrogen valves back in 1969 and since then we have supplied valves on cryogenic and high pressure and temperature hydrogen duties around the world. We supplied our first carbon capture subsea choke over 18 years ago for a major Norwegian operator that is still performing today and more recently we have secured orders for valves for a new flagship CO2 storage project that draw heavily on our experience on similar pressure and flow duties seen in oil and gas production Meg injection.”For more information, see below.T 01484 710311info@kentintrol.comwww.kentintrol.com",

      "DetailDescription" : "An international manufacturer and designer of agricultural, fruit and food\nmachinery,  with UK headquarters approached us as they required a pump\nmanufacturer and supplier to work alongside their technical and design\nengineering department to specify the correct pumping technology for all\ntheir products. Their goal was to find a UK based company that could not\nonly supply the equipment required to install on their machinery but to\nprovide full technical support to their UK engineering team and also work\nin conjunction with the project managers to provide support at\ncommissioning and installation stage if required.\n\nOur customer was having difficulties communicating with their current\nsuppliers, they had too many suppliers and this was causing a lot of issues\nfor them, which in their eyes was not possible to avoid as they were using\nmany different pump technologies for the various fluids they process. These\ninclude fruit juices and vegetable oils as well as waste materials, hence\ndealing with only one manufacturer was not going to work. We welcomed this\nchallenge with open arms.\n\nAs North Ridge Pumps offer several pump technologies, we offer the most\nappropriate pumping equipment for your application rather than offer a\nsingle pump type which may not provide the longevity required for your\nprocess.\n\nAfter meeting with the project engineering manager and their senior design\nand installation engineers, we decided that given the technical expertise\nrequired to deal with this customer, it was best for one of our technical\nproject managers to be their first point of contact for all their\ncommercial and technical queries, needless to say, it was the correct\ndecision as not only is it easier for our customer to have a single point\nof contact but this also means they now have answers to their queries in a\nmuch more timely manner.\n\nWe supplied our customer two of our Nova Rotors DXC1L1-AISI-316L, hygienic\nprogressing cavity pumps, also known as Mono pumps or eccentric screw\npumps, this was one of the first few products we supplied to this customer.\nThe units are being used to handle crude and filtered soy oil, also called\nsoybean oil. Firstly, we recommended that our customer changed the pump\ntype being used for their filtered oil as they were currently using a\ncentrifugal pump. Due to the potential changes in temperature and viscosity\ndepending where in the world their equipment was installed it was unlikely\nfor the centrifugal pump to have the same performance from region to\nregion, thus a positive displacement pump was a much better solution for\ntheir system.\n\nBoth pumps can cope with the potential change in temperature and viscosity\nas well as being able to handle solids up to 12mm, giving them additional\npeace of mind. Our DX and JX sanitary progressing cavity pump range is\nextremely versatile, they can be used with highly viscous fluids with\nviscosities up to 1,000,000 cSt but also thin products such as milk, fruit\njuices, wine etc. furthermore they have various accessories available,\nincluding; mobile trolley, built-in hopper, CIP connection integrated into\nthe pump body, dry running protection, bypass valve, control panel,\ninverter, heating jacket, grinder and others upon request.\n\nSome of the main benefits of our DX and JX progressive cavity pump range\nare:\nFood grade EHEDG and 3A certified\nExcellent for shear sensitive fluids due to low pulsations\nExcellent at pumping fluids containing solids in suspension\nIncorporated bearing lubrication system\nReversible flow up to 3 bar as standard, Up to 12 bar with hydraulic\nbalance\n\nSpecific details of the pumps supplied to our customer are as follows:\nModel: DXC1L1-AISI-316L Hygienic Progressing Cavity Pumps\nCapacity: 0.5m³/hr & 1m³/hr\nMaximum Head: 10m & 35m\nInlet/Outlet: Hygienic Connections: DN32 - DIN 11851 (AISI-316L)\n\nT +44 (0)1773 302660\nsales@northridgepumps.com\nwww.northridgepumps.com\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "nIn this issue of Industrial Process News, we have chosen T-T Pumps as our Pump Solutions Company of the Month. \n\nEstablished in 1959 as Vanroy, in Burslem, Stoke on Trent, the company started out as a general engineering company, and branched out into pumps around 1970. \n\nThis led to the company building a reputation with electric submersible pumps, acquired by a Danish company in 1978. From 1983, T-T Pumps started to design and manufacture control systems and provided continuous steady growth, leading to the business being acquired by the current owners in 1989, returning the company to full British ownership, who are still involved. Starting out with 25 employees and a turnover of £1.2 million, the company continued to grow and moved to its current location at Woore, South Cheshire in 1998.The site being a 6.5 acre site with originally 11,000 sq feet of works and warehouse space. \n\n“Over recent years, the business has organically grown by strengthening existing markets and introducing new products and services, now employing 120 staff. Our works and warehousing have grown to 32,000 sq feet with extensive warehousing, a new manufacturing area and remotely located repair workshop for the repair of effluent and drainage pumps.” Bob Nash, Managing Director.\n\nDisplaying a wealth of knowledge built from its resounding years of experience, T-T Pumps has positioned itself as one of the UK’s leading companies in the design, manufacture, supply, installation and service of pumps, controls and valves. Not only does T-T Pumps manufacture, but the company is also the sole or main UK agent for a wide range of pumps. \n\n“We provide pumping systems, control systems, flow management, pumping station design provision, installation and commissioning, plus, after sales service with monitoring. We offer a wide range of quality products and services with an enthusiastic skilled and trained team who can provide full customer support and service.” Bob said. \n\nT-T Pumps provides its services for a wide variety of industries and markets, related by their requirement of transferring liquids. Bob explained, “whether its effluents, drainage, waste liquids through to potable water for domestic consumption and industrial processes. Some would suggest we are in the water industry, but our range of industries is wide, from building and construction industries to agriculture and many more. There are not many industries that we do not touch.”\n\nT-T Pumps constantly strives to improve the features within its range and continuously searches for new innovative products to add to its portfolio. The company is committed to pushing the boundaries of its products to incorporate the most efficient, reliable and innovative capabilities, resulting in long term benefits for its customers.  \n\n“Our quality products are well designed for life and reliability. Our products are further supported by experts in their fields.” Bob mentioned.\n\nA noteworthy feat within its product range, T-T Pumps’ SEER Monitoring is one of the most innovative, highly advanced monitoring systems available on the market. The system enables T-T Pumps to monitor pumping stations and plants 24/7 with live status and alarm activation. \n\nAnother noteworthy addition in its product range is the Planet Range of Package Pumping Stations. Designed and manufactured by T-T Pumps, the Planet Range provides an efficient and economical way of installing a sewage/drainage pumping station and provides large retention volumes integral to a single chamber design.\n\nSpeaking with Bob, he told us about some of the latest developments for the company. He stated that, “After extending its premises by 60%, the works facility has been streamlined to provide a better workflow in the warehouse and new machinery has now been introduced to increase our inhouse manufacturing capability of Made in Britain products.”\n\nAs the demand for greater technical ability is required, T-T Pumps is taking the need for training at all levels, very seriously.\n\n“Today, we have eight apprentices at all levels from artisan to graduates, we try to give our apprentices a broad experience of the business, so they are multi skilled and flexible.” Bob continued, “Our management team, joined us initially as trainees who have now grown and developed through the business.”\n\nDue to the ongoing implications from the COVID-19 pandemic, many industries and businesses have faced their own challenges during such unprecedented times. From lockdowns, furlough and work from home to a cease of production and job loss, COVID-19 has created a resonating impact on all industries. Responding and rising to these challenges, is undoubtedly what has helped position T-T Pumps as the leader in its field and allowed the company to maintain its services throughout the pandemic. \n\nBob explained that, “Initially customer activity reduced, but within days we realised that demand was strong for our products and services, gaining key worker status within days of the initial lockdown.  Our main concern was the safety of our staff, customers, suppliers and the general public, for who we came into contact with. Several of our staff were furloughed at the start of the lockdown, with a skeleton staff of 26 maintaining our operation, after putting in place strict COVID-19 preventative measures we gradually returned to full capacity by late summer 2020. We have the support and understanding of our staff, in maintaining the very highest levels of hygiene and COVID-19 prevention.”\n\nIn terms of the company’s future plans, Bob told us that, “We are looking to continue our growth across all our markets by providing quality products and services.”\n\nFor any further, please see the details featured below.\n\nT +44 (0)1630 647200\n\nwww.ttpumps.com",

      "DetailDescription" : "Industrial Process News is pleased to announce that EMS Industries Ltd has been awarded with our prestigious Pump Technology Company of the Month profile in light of their continually excellent waste water services.\n\nEMS was first set up back in 1995 by the three existing Directors: John Nash, Chris Melvin and David Bates. The company initially started out as a service repair organisation but over time moved into ram pump manufacturing, which they are now highly renowned for. Based in Stoke on Trent, and with representation in the USA and Asia, the company specialise in manufacturing positive displacement ram pumps and grit removal solutions. In addition, they can also provide pre-award support, full CAD and 3D modelling and a full after sales support package that includes commissioning, operator training, servicing and spare parts supply.\n\nTheir pumps are highly sought after around the world within the wastewater sector, with numerous frameworks in place for the likes of Severn Trent Water, United Utilities, Yorkshire Water and Scottish water, as well as for a range of other utility companies. \n\nWe spoke to Sales Manager, Steve Hannigan about how their pumps garnered such popularity, to which he explained, “The EMS pump, by the very nature of its design is built to last and we have many examples of pumps that were provided over 20 years ago that are still performing now, way outlasting the stated asset life required by our customers. The design and operation of the EMS pumps and grit removal equipment is such that any maintainence tasks are quick and easy to undertake, but most importantly the equipment is renowned for its reliability, providing customers with long, trouble free operation.”\n\nOutside of wastewater, EMS has also expanded into the AD & Biogas market, providing pumps for food waste facilities. Steve added, “Our ever growing AD & Biogas client base now sees us providing equipment for companies such as Biogen, Fernbrook Bio, GENeco, Bio-Collectors & Bioganics. We see the AD & Biogas sector as having huge potential for us both in the UK and further afield.”\n\nEMS are constantly innovating and developing more advanced products, one of which includes the recently launched EMS HYDRAKE which is a hydraulically driven grit rake that takes the ‘standard’ grit rake from the 20th into the 21st century. Built with maintainability at the forefront of its design the HYDRAKE operates at 2 strokes per minute unlike the traditional rakes which operate at 12 – 14 strokes, this provides enormous savings on maintenance and power consumption.\n\nIt works by pushing grit from a Detritor up a slope into a collection skip. The HYDRAKE is a totally modular built unit saving on costly installation time and can be manufactured bespoke to customer’s requirements.\n\nAnother newly released product is the CVRD300 ram pump. This twin ram pump provides flow up to 900 litre/min with discharge pressures up to 5 bar, being a mechanical pumps means that no hydraulic power pack is required thus saving on potential environmental issues but with huge power saving.\n\nLike all EMS pumps the CVRD300 can be used on varying applications from standard de-sludge, digester feed, grit removal and now also on food waste pumping.\n\nEMS are dedicated to growing the business across the industry as well as growing it internally. Steve explains, “As part of our plans to ensure that EMS are around for many years, we have looked long and hard at succession planning and have recently internally promoted two employees to the positions of Associate Directors. We have also introduced the EMS Apprentice Scheme which runs in conjunction with two local colleges and Universities.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more information about the company, be sure to get in contact using the number below or feel free to check out the website.\n\nT +44 (0)1782 510051\nwww.emsindustriesltd.com\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "A|2|O Technology Group is on a mission to remove the barriers to the adoption of advanced composite materials in volume applications, helping companies to reduce CO2 emissions and increase composites component manufacturing efficiency. Subsequently, after years of exciting development, A|2|O Technology Group is inviting customers to get in touch and discover how it can help develop systems tailored to their needs.\n\n\n\nThe company’s founder, Chris Berg, identified opportunities in the composite industry, after noticing several barriers that deterred companies from adopting this technology. For many, costs are too high, and the reliability of composite components are too low compared with those made from legacy materials, such as metal.\n\n\n\nTo combat this, A|2|O Technology Group is now offering affordable and sustainable composite manufacturing and reliability products. “Our technologies can help make things more cost-effective, and we can simulate the process and the costs of manufacture before putting systems in place,” explained Chris. “We work with the customer, rather than just offering them a single solution that can’t be adapted. We are customer-centric to ensure we are developing products that suit their needs, looking at the whole product cycle from concept, to manufacture, through to service life.”\n\n\n\nChris has been developing A|2|O Technology Group full time since 2016, and now the hard work is paying off. “We’ve been awarded funding from the Liverpool City Region Future Innovation Fund, and we’ve been identified as a high growth potential business on the LCR TechClimbers 2021 Ones to Watch” list.\n\n\n\n“We’ve spent a lot of time developing our technology, identifying the need in the market, and staying in touch with this need. These recent awards show that we have done the right thing, and we’re now looking at demonstrations throughout this year and developing contracts to continue growing the business. We welcome anyone to get in touch if they would like to develop composite component technology to suit their product developments.”\n\n\n\nOf course, for a company as innovative as A|2|O Technology Group, the development never stops, and the company is still working on enhancing its products. However, during 2021 it will be able to supply its CHASM System to customers for benefit trials. This is in addition to launching some manufacturing demonstrations into its adoption base.\n\n\n\nCHASM offers on-board and fully active structural and condition health monitoring for predictive maintenance, increasing the safety of high reliability and safety critical systems such as Transportation Assets and Renewable Energy Systems. It indicates and tracks changes and indicates degradation before it becomes critical, reducing the need for lengthy and costly preventative maintenance solutions that are currently used.\n\n\n\nAs well as developing its products, A|2|O Technology Group is working on developing the company brand and website to emphasise the commercial focus of its offerings. “Our registered company name is Acorn 2Oak Innovation Solutions, but we realised that this was quite wordy and made people think that we are purely consultancy based, whereas in reality we’re predominantly a manufacturer and system supplier. So, we now trade as A|2|O Technology Group with four key divisions: A|2|O Innovation, A|2|O Licensing, A|2|O Manufacturing, and A|2|O Predictive Maintenance. This rebrand will soon become clear on our website.”\n\n\n\nThis is in addition to its plans for geographical growth. A|2|O Technology Group is very much a part of the plan to grow the local Liverpool City Region economy, the company is also looking to the rest of the country with connections in the North, the Midlands, and the South. “We’ve also been out to South Korea and the USA, to support our global ambitions as well. Everything is coming together nicely and I’m excited to see what happens next as we move into commercial growth.”\n\n\n\nGet in touch using the details below to find out how A|2|O Technology Group can help you.\n\n\n\nT +44 (0)1925 751534\n\nenquiries@a2otg.com\n\nwww.a2otg.com",

      "DetailDescription" : "Updates from The UK Plastics Pact annual report show progress in the fight\n  against single-use plastic, but how can others follow in their footsteps?\n Andrea Falco provides comment on how businesses can continue the good work.\n\nIt’s undeniable that we’re facing a global climate emergency. Infiltrating\neveryday life, our use of single-use plastic is now accelerating the crisis\nat a dramatic pace.\n\nEvery year in the UK, it’s estimated that five million tonnes of plastic is\nused - nearly half of that is packaging. Alarmingly, one third of plastic\nproduced globally is not recyclable, meaning it’s then sent to landfill or\nends up in our natural environment. As plastic takes hundreds of years to\ndegrade and break down into microplastics, the chemicals produced thus have\nan extremely harmful impact on our marine life, natural world and health.\n\nTo combat this issue, companies across the nation are doing all in their\npower to improve sustainable efforts by signing up to the Plastics Pact.\nLed by Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), this is the first in a\nglobal network of pacts, working towards the circular economy for plastics.\nBy 2020 it aims to have all plastic packaging reused, recycled or composted\nby meeting four world-leading targets. Over 140 manufacturers, including\nAsda and P&G have already signed up.\n\nAlthough this is a huge step in the right direction, immediate action is\nstill required from all, but in particular from packaging plants,\ndistribution centres and retailers in setting their own targets and\ninvesting in the right environmental technologies to eliminate single-use\nplastic.\n\nCurrent climate\nWith millions of tonnes of microplastics being discarded into the\nenvironment every year, it’s no surprise that the material is now\ncontaminating the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink.\nAlthough we’re all aware of its harmful impacts, the plastic industry is\nstill the second largest and fastest-growing source of industrial\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and 99% of what goes into the material is\nderived from fossil fuels.\n\nCurrently, GHG emissions from the plastic lifecycle, which includes the\ntransport of fossil fuels for production, its manufacture and waste\nmanagement, are threatening the ability of the global community to keep\nglobal temperature rise below 1.5°C degrees. With fossil fuel companies\nlooking to increase plastic production by 40% in the next decade this will\nonly continue to exacerbate, and as some have claimed, create a “near\npermanent contamination of the natural environment”.\n\nMismanagement and inappropriate disposal are now resulting in more than\neight million tonnes of plastic waste entering our oceans and environment\nevery year – it’s even been found in the Mariana Trench, which is the\ndeepest place on earth. A study has also revealed that plastic at the\nocean’s surface continually releases methane and other greenhouse gases,\nand that these emissions increase as the material further disintegrates.\n\nProgress so far\nThe Plastics Pact is fighting to transform the way the UK uses, makes and\ndisposes of single-use plastic and our supermarkets are leading the way in\ntackling the problem.\n\nLast year, WRAP reported that supermarkets had already removed 3,400 tonnes\nof unnecessary plastic packaging from fresh produce – the equivalent of 272\nLondon buses – and 137.5m plastic stickers from fruit and vegetables.\nStores such as Morrisons and Co-op have also removed black plastic (which\ncannot be recycled) from all of its own brand food and drink packaging.\n\nBeauty brands such as Unilever and Dove are also stepping up by moving to\n100% recycled plastic bottles in Europe and North America – across all\ntheir ranges. To encourage recycling, soft drink brands such as Pepsi and\nTango have also added a ‘please recycle me’ message to their bottles.\n\nAside from the pact, a number of other initiatives, such as the\ngovernment’s Resource and Waste Strategy and New Plastics Economy Global\nCommitment, have been put in place to address plastic waste. In a bid to\nencourage distributors to consider their packaging practices, in April\n2022, the government will be introducing a ‘plastic tax’ on packaging that\nincludes less than 30% recycled material.\n\nHowever, it’s not only on the onus of the government and Plastics Pact\nmembers to tackle the issue. As the plastic problem is a global disaster,\nall businesses and organisations should be stepping up to their\nresponsibility by setting their own targets.\n\nNow it’s your turn\nIt’s simple – to reduce our plastic intake, ‘throwaway culture’ needs to\nchange. Businesses need to move towards a more circular model that\nencourages individuals to view plastic as a renewable resource that should\nbe kept in our economy and out of the natural environment.\n\nThe key to this is to examine and refine waste management practices.\nInvesting in lasting environmental technologies will dramatically reduce\nyour carbon footprint and decrease the amount of waste going to landfill.\nSo not only will you be saving on the landfill tax, you’ll also be\nprotecting our planet for future generations.\n\nBalers can improve internal waste management systems by compressing the\nvolume of waste by up to 95%. Compacting waste into unmixed bales,\noptimised for transportation helps to reduce emissions and running costs.\nBaling is also valuable as it’s likely to generate a return on investment\non your waste when collected by recycling centres.\n\nCardboard perforators are ideal for those seeking quick and easy plastic\npackaging alternatives. Transforming waste into free biodegradable\npackaging material, this machine eliminates the need to use single-use\nplastic packaging, such as bubble wrap and saves the amount of waste going\nto landfill.\n\nAside from this, distribution centres and packaging plants should consider\nhow they can improve their own internal recycling procedures. For example,\nall businesses have a duty of care to ensure that they are using a\nresponsible waste collector. It should also be a constant goal to encourage\nemployees to continue waste management practices as it’ll improve your\ncompanies’ green credentials, and thus its public reputation.\n\nIt’s never too late\nChange requires high levels of investment and innovation, which cannot be\ndone by the Plastics Pact members alone. So, as manufacturers and\ndistributors across the nation unite to eradicate single-use plastic from\nour everyday life, make sure your business does not get left behind in this\nbattle.\n\nAs a global shift has to come from the top up – all manufacturers and\ndistributors should be taking the initiative by starting with the simple\nact of re-evaluating waste management practices and invest in long-term\nenvironmental technologies.\n\n\nSources\n\nawsassets.panda.org/downloads/plastic_ingestion_press_singles.pdf\n\nhttps://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plastic-and-Climate-FINAL-\n2019.pdf\n\ncircularonline.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/WRAP-Problematic-single-use-\nplastic-materials_REPORT.pdf\n\njuliesbicycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/JB-Plastics-Briefing_Web.pdf\n\nnewplasticseconomy.org/assets/doc/Global-Commitment-2019-Progress-Report-\nSummary.pdf\n\ntelegraph.co.uk/business/reducing-plastic-waste/plastic-in-the-environment/\n\ntelegraph.co.uk/business/reducing-plastic-waste/uk-recycling/\n\ntheguardian.com/environment/2019/may/15/single-use-plastics-a-serious-\nclimate-change-hazard-study-warns\n\nunenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/tackling-environmental-scourge-\nsingle-use-plastics-through-legal-and\n\nwrap.org.uk/content/new-report-shows-where-uk-plastics-pact-members-stand-\nagainst-targets-and-where-future-chall\n\nwrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/The-UK-Plastics-Pact-report-18-19.pdf\n\n\nAbout HSM®\nThe product portfolio at HSM environmental technology includes vertical and\nhorizontal filling lid baling presses with a pressing force of 3 to 70\ntons, as well as semi-automatic and fully automatic channel baling presses\nwith up to 150 tons of pressing force.

We currently have complete mobile thickening and dewatering centrifuge systems as small as a few m3/hr to in excess of 90m3/hr in various sizes.\n\nMachines are suitable for the most difficult of materials and liquid wastes from a variety of sources including sewage, potable water, food, soil, dairy, pharmaceutical, petrochemical, brewing, animal feeds, tannery, biofuels, nuclear applications and silt from quarrying industries and recycled aggregates - in fact any sludge or effluent.\n\nThey can be hired with an operator for long (months or years) to short term contracts (a few weeks). Our machines are fully integrated onto a skid or into containers or trailers with all the necessary ancillaries – pumps, pipes, poly system and flow meters - ready for work within a few hours of being on site.\n\nThe dewatering fleet consists of centrifuges, disc stack separators, filter presses and belt presses. Machines are occasionally supplied on a ‘today’ basis, often ‘tomorrow’ and frequently within a few days.\n\nIf you need mobile dewatering in the UK or Ireland contact Euroby for more details: \nT 01903 694400\nsales@euroby.com\nwww.euroby.com\n\nUsing Euroby to meet your mobile dewatering/particle separation needs\nDewatering (and thickening) is an essential process across a whole range of industries, including refineries, the pharmaceutical sector, mining operations, the petroleum industry, food and beverage manufacture and various others. Municipal organisations use dewatering in both sewage and potable/drinking water applications.\n\nIn essence, dewatering involves the separation of solid matter from water using filtration and centrifugal technology, either as part of a manufacturing process or to separate waste products for more effective reuse or disposal.\n\nWhy don’t companies just do it themselves?\nWhen dewatering is such an essential part of a manufacturing process, you might wonder why businesses in the above sectors will turn to Euroby instead of simply installing their own dewatering technology.\n\nSometimes it is a simple case of their own equipment having broken down or not being able to meet capacity demands, in which case Euroby is always ready to step in as and when needed. However, as is the case in so many areas of business, there is a growing trend towards outsourcing non-core activities. Euroby has the skills, experience and equipment to carry out the dewatering function faster, cheaper and better.\n\nWhat makes Euroby the best choice?\nAs well as 20+ years’ experience in the dewatering business in our own right, Euroby is a partner of Flottweg, and we are proud to have their worldwide network and expertise working alongside us. This gives us unprecedented access to the best knowledge, the latest equipment and the most cutting-edge research in all aspects of dewatering.\n\nDespite this, every industry that we work with is constantly evolving, so we face new challenges almost every week. If we are presented with a new form of sludge material which has never been or is difficult to dewater, we have the tools and the experience to find the solution quickly and effectively.\n\nOur engineers will pay a visit to the site, take a sample and perform what is known as a spin test. This will give an immediate indication of the separation efficiency using g-force. If necessary we can then follow up this preliminary analysis with laboratory testing that will provide us more accurate separation data. At this stage, we can identify the best dewatering strategy to adopt.\n\nWorking with Euroby\nCustomers can always get hold of someone 24/7 in case of emergencies, and our call-out teams are ready to deal with anything at short notice when it is a matter of urgency.\n\nFor more routine enquiries, we will gather the necessary data relating to the type of job, the flow rate and so on in order to determine the type of equipment that will be needed.\n\nThe dewatering equipment will typically consist of a centrifuge mounted either within a container or trailer or on a frame, which can be operated either outside or within a building. All our equipment has the capacity to operate completely independently, using its own power supply or generator, alternatively, it can be run from the client’s power supply if appropriate.\n\nAt Euroby, we deliver a one-stop solution, supplying all the necessary equipment and reagents, and remove the processed material in the most appropriate way.\n\nT 01903 694400\nsales@euroby.com\nwww.euroby.com",

Our team are therefore keen to tell our readership base more about the aims of this organisation whilst detailing its core capabilities and most significant movements.\n\nThe vision at Pentair is relatively simple in its nature yet incredibly important when put into practice: to ensure a healthy and safe future for both the planet and its inhabitants by implementing forward-thinking approaches and industry-leading solutions relating to water, energy and food.\n\nThis has remained a constant point of focus for the Manchester-based business. Ever since its establishment in 1966 the five founding members Murray Harpole, Vern Stone, Vincent Follmer, Leroy Nelson and Gary Ostrand set out to create an enterprise centred on the provision of innovative and inspiring products designed to meet the needs of this ever-changing world. The result was Pentair, an international water, fluid process, thermal management and equipment protection partner striving to enhance the environment for generations to come with its rigorous approaches and high performance product portfolio. \n\nThe range of widely appreciated solutions includes valves & pumps, advanced filtration & desalination, aquaculture systems, communications & electronics enclosures, crop spray & protection, dewatering, wastewater and flood water systems, food & beverage processing, industrial heat tracing, irrigation management, oil & gas separation systems, pool equipment, thermal building solutions, water purification & filtration and water supply & disposal.\n\n“Here in the UK we serve the food, beverage, dairy, energy, pharmaceutical, residential and commercial industries with our hygienic valves, pumps and turnkey process solutions, which can be developed specifically for each of these segments,” explained Pentair’s Sales Director Ivan Rigney. “We also provide pieces of specialist equipment for water treatment and biogas applications, servicing the needs of everyone from small dairies, breweries and farming communities to the largest pharmaceutical and beverage blue chip companies.\n\n“One of our biggest distinctions when compared to our competitors is the fact that we focus on providing added value to our customers; our core solutions offer customers a level of unmatched quality as well as leading edge life cycle costs together with an overall attractive return on investment. The company philosophy relates to ‘winning right’, which essentially means that we aim to be successful by putting the customer first.”\n\nPentair operates in a collaborative manner, establishing long-term working relationships not only with its esteemed clientele but also with industrial partners, non-governmental organisations and government bodies. Remaining ethically driven and service-oriented ensures complete customer satisfaction, and an ongoing penchant for adaptability enables further improvement and sustained innovation.\n\n“We have progressed year on year here at Pentair and have experienced year on year growth,” Ivan said conclusively when asked to discuss the company’s recent performance and plans for the future. “We are looking to maintain this level of steady growth whilst supporting our customers across the width and breadth of the UK. Our priority will be focusing on our core markets whilst making a strategic move further into segments heretofore we have been less active in.”\n\nPlease get in touch with the Pentair group today if you are interested in finding out more information.",

In Halma’s words, the Manufacturing Excellence Award for 2016 “recognises companies where major changes in manufacturing have resulted in sustainable, improved business performance”.\n\nBeating off competition from more than 40 other subsidiaries, HWM took the award thanks to right-first-time pass rates above 98% and on-time deliveries over 95%. The company has standardised product design platforms to reduce work in progress and increase throughput. It has improved its design process, developing novel design validation tests and online test and calibration systems. Achieving ATEX certification has allowed HWM to move into two new markets.\n\nOperations Director, Mick Bolton, explained, “The whole operation is engaged with continuous improvement – it is now embedded in our daily routine.”\n\nIn a separate development, HWM has also received the Halma Innovation Award for 2016 for the PermaNet+ remote leak noise monitoring system. A vote among more than 200 of Halma’s senior executives returned HWM as the winner.\n\nPermaNet+ senses vibration in water distribution networks caused by leaky pipes. The system analyses the acoustic wave signature form produced by the leak sound, decides whether a leak is present and reports the status to a remote user over the GSM network. ",

For over twelve months shaft and tunnel inspections have not been undertaken as Yorkshire Water’s Raw Water Management Team deemed the tunnel too high risk to enter, in terms of successfully and safely effecting a rescue, should the need arise.\n\nThe 240m x 1.4m diameter tunnel is mostly taken up by the draw off pipe and concrete stools, as well as hose reels on top of the pipe at set intervals. This leaves very little room for manoeuvre within the tunnel, which additionally has a constant flow of 3-4 inches of ground water in the invert mixed with ochre, which makes the underfoot conditions slippery.\n\nThe inspections are a necessary part of the maintenance programme that Yorkshire Water needs to carry out, therefore entry into the tunnel needed to take place. \n\nTo enable these inspections, Yorkshire Water asked PMP Utilities to submit a rescue plan – not just submit for someone in an office to approve, but to provide a demonstration of a rescue from a worst case scenario within the tunnel.\n\nThe PMP rescue team included its in-house medic who, as well as assisting in rescues, is trained to provide medical intervention should the need arise. Using specialist equipment identified as best for task, in tandem with some techniques not taught on the standard confined space rescue courses, two rescues were successfully undertaken without issue.",

The two main metal filaments that we offer for industrial applications are BASF Ultrafuse 316L and 17-4PH. The 316L filament is a metal-polymer composite suitable for making tools, fixtures, jigs, small-batch parts, and functional components. The 17-4PH filament comprises metal powder with a polymer binder and has been developed for applications requiring high hardness and mechanical strength.Ultimaker has a new CC print core with a hardened stainless steel nozzle to facilitate high accuracy printing with abrasive materials such as 316L and 17-4PH. There are two nozzle sizes -0.4mm, which enables greater detail and enhanced surface finish, while the wider 0.6mm results in a faster print.In September 2020, 3DGBIRE partnered with CMG Technologies to offer a UK post-processing service for additively manufactured metal parts using BASF Ultrafuse filaments. Customers can now receive a quick and efficient service in the UK to 3D print their parts and send them to CMG to get a 96% dense metal part.

      "DetailDescription" : "With an ever-growing focus on the environmental impact of plastic, and more\nand more Government initiatives aimed at  driving reductions in single use\nplastic, companies across the country are searching for ways to replace\ntheir plastic packaging. In most packaging areas this can be achieved quite\neffectively and, as packaging manufacturers apply their minds to developing\nplastic free products, the range on offer improves and becomes affordable\nfor most companies.However, there is one area where there is not yet a viable alternative to\nplastic – pallet wrapping. Literally millions of companies use plastic\nstretch wrap in huge quantities, and there’s no sign of a viable plastic\nfree solution on the horizon. Instead, the focus needs to be on reducing\nthe single use plastic used in the pallet wrapping process.This is where Hazel 4D can really help. They have brought together the\nAtlanta range of pallet wrapping machinery and the Extremus range of\nmachine films to create a winning combination. “We often talk to large\nusers of pallet wrap who pay very little attention to this aspect of their\nprocess,” says Kevin Oliver, Technical Sales Manager at Hazel 4D. “Many\npeople don’t spend much time reviewing the type of pallet wrap film they\nuse, or the quality and condition of their machinery. Often the film is a\nlot thicker than it needs to be and the machines are old or not well\nmaintained. However, the combination of a decent quality stretch film and a\ngood pallet wrapping machine can not only have a profound effect on\nefficiency but, when optimised correctly, can massively reduce the amount\nof plastic used and the cost per pallet wrapped, whilst simultaneously\nimproving load stability.”“It really is a no brainer when you look at the numbers,” continues Kevin.\n“We regularly demonstrate to companies that using our process and\nexpertise, we can reduce their film usage by 80%, and their costs by 50-60%\nper pallet wrapped, AND improve the pallet load stability at the same\ntime.”Get in touch to find out more:\nT 0113 242 6999\nwecare@hazel4d.com\nwww.hazel4d.com\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Manchester-based thermoformed packaging manufacturer, Mister Blister, has invested in its second Illig machine in 12 months as part of an ongoing investment plan.\n\nThe company, which specialises in tamper-resistant blister packs, purchased the Illig RD 53d automatic roll fed thermoforming machine to facilitate continued growth. The RD 53d features Illig’s ‘Intelligent Control Concept’ (IC), which offers both advanced process optimisation, as well as electric servomotor drives on all movements, enabling reduced cycle times and higher outputs.\n\n“It is important for us that we work with suppliers who share our own aspirations for innovation and efficiency, and each new generation of Illig machines gives us an abundance of both,” said Mister Blister’s Managing Director, Gary Briscoe. “Illig are always looking at ways of enhancing their machines and this in turn enables us to push out the boundaries of blister design whilst still maintaining our competitive advantage.”\n\nMister Blister says in order to maintain its high level of designing and production of packaging for a wide range of industries it will continue to invest in new machinery and equipment. The company has confirmed its next purchase will be an Illig RV 74d, a model released at the beginning of 2016.\n\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "New at Allen Coding: Diagraph IJ4000 series inkjet system\n\nAllen Coding announces the launch of the latest Diagraph IJ Series printer, the Diagraph IJ4000 high-resolution large character inkjet system designed to print alphanumerics, barcodes and graphics onto porous substrates. This cost-competitive printer combines industry-leading barcode decode-ability, industry-leading system durability and industry-leading print throw distance with the lowest maintenance requirements on the market.\n\nThree unique features combine to allow the Diagraph IJ4000 to provide best-in-the-market print consistency on challenging packaging lines where boxes are rarely perfectly uniform.\n\nFirstly, precision print placement is ensured by a unique roller retractor and a digital level sensor accelerometer. The roller retractor provides a consistent gap between the print surface and print engine. A green LED light on the digital level accelerometer indicates when the print engines are perfectly aligned and perpendicular with the packaging material to be printed- regardless of floor variations. This ensures high-quality print and optimal readability for bar codes.\n\nSecondly, the print engines of the Diagraph IJ4000 provide throw distances of 12mm for alphanumerics and an industry-leading 6mm for barcodes. This is double the 3mm throw distance currently provided in the market for readable barcodes. In addition to ensuring high-quality print, the increased throw distance also reduces the impact of corrugate dust, glue and contaminants resulting in reduced maintenance needs.\n\nFinally, the unique design of the print engine ensures print is high contrast.\n\nCombined these features allow the Diagraph IJ4000 to offer a 35% improvement on barcode decode-ability compared to competing systems available in the market.\n\n",
