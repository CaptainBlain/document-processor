      "DetailDescription" : "At Tradex News we are delighted to recognise companies that offer their clients a world class service and product. This is why we are thrilled to present Conex Bänninger with our prestigious Plumbing Fittings Manufacturer of the Month profile. Conex Bänninger has been awarded this title for its unique innovation and fantastic service. \n\nThe company can trace its roots back to the early 1900s when two independent businesses were established - Bänninger in Giessen, Germany, in 1909, and the Sanbra Engineering Company in Birmingham in 1919, later to become Conex-Sanbra. By 1991 both Bänninger and Conex-Sanbra are part of the IBP Group, with the two brands merging in 1994 to form today’s Conex Bänninger. \n\nFor over more than a century, the company has designed and manufactured more than 20 billion fittings and valves for domestic, industrial and commercial applications. As a leading European manufacturer, with its headquarters in the West Midlands and production facilities in Poland and Spain, it is a major supplier to markets in the UK, the rest of Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, North America, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nWorking with customers in the plumbing, HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), refrigeration and medical sectors, it aims to continually develop new products, leading innovation in fittings for copper, carbon, stainless steel and plastic components.\n\nFor Original Equipment Manufacturers, Conex Bänninger offers a bespoke service with its expert engineering and technical teams talking through customers’ often complex requirements before delivering high quality tailored solutions. More than just producing plumbing fittings, Conex Bänninger values the relationship it has with its clients, offering exceptional after-sales service and technical support. \n\nIn an interview we asked Bill Barlow, UK Business Unit Director for ACR (air conditioning and refrigeration) and OEM, to outline the benefits of Conex Bänninger fittings.\n\n“Conex Bänninger is well established in the ACR market having supplied fittings to ACR installers and engineers since the 1950s. In 2016 we introduced the truly innovative and award-winning >B< MaxiPro, a flame-free copper press joint developed specifically for the air conditioning and refrigeration sector.\n\n“As a flame-free alternative to traditional brazing, it negates the need for a hot works permit and the ACR engineer no longer has to manhandle unwieldly gas bottles around.”\n\nIt also enables the user to be more productive, with a press fitting taking just five seconds to complete, once initial preparation has been done. This is around three times faster than traditional brazing.\n\nWith brazing, because of the fire risk, an office, school or apartment block would have to be closed while a new air conditioning system is being installed. But with flame-free >B< MaxiPro there is no risk of fire so employees and the public can have unhindered access and the ‘normal’ day can continue.\n\n>B< MaxiPro has the benefit of Conex Bänninger’s 3-point press, one mechanical press each side of the bead and a third, hydraulic, press crimping the O-ring, providing a permanent, repeatable joint. It also has a pressing indicator, which causes a leak at low pressure if the fitting has not been pressed or is improperly pressed, thus alerting the engineer that the joint needs completing correctly.\n\nTo support the industry in maintaining high standards, Conex Bänninger offers installers free training in how to use press fittings, including >B< MaxiPro.\n\n>B< MaxiPro was named Commercial HVAC Product of the Year - Components, Controls & Accessories in the H&V News Awards 2018, as judged by a high level panel of industry experts.\nIn response to a question about plans for the future, Bill said the company will be celebrating its 110th anniversary in 2019, in addition to further developing its extensive product range, and continuing to strengthen good relationships with clients, as well as nurturing new ones. \nBill also told us about the company’s busy marketing programme, presenting the company’s extensive range at international trade shows.\n\n“For the ACR sector the leading shows we attend include Chillventa in Germany and AHR Expo in Chicago.”\n\nConex Bänninger also attends ISH in Frankfurt, The Big Five in Dubai, VSK in Utrecht and ARBS in Sydney.\n\nBill explained: “The shows provide us with a great opportunity to meet customers, existing and potential new ones, and to talk directly to contractors, plumbing and heating installers, and ACR engineers.\n\n“They are the perfect platform for us to introduce new products to each local market.\n“In 2019 and beyond we will maintain our philosophy of excellence with further product development and a continued focus on strengthening existing relationships with customers.”\n\nFor details on the full range of Conex Bänninger fittings and valves visit www.conexbanninger.com.\n\nEnds\n\nIssued by HROC PR Ltd.

      "Description" : "Sustainability Today is proud to announce that PI UK has been selected to receive our Industrial Networking Systems Company of the Year award.",
      "DetailDescription" : "Sustainability Today is proud to announce that PI UK has been selected to receive our Industrial Networking Systems Company of the Year award. PI UK is part of PROFIBUS & PROFINET International (PI), the largest automation community in the world responsible for PROFIBUS and PROFINET, the two most important enabling technologies in automation today.\n\nEstablished in Germany in 1989 by a group of leading equipment manufacturers and technical universities, the organisation had the goal of helping German industry automate as many production processes as possible and link them effectively to IT management systems. PI UK was set up in 1993 in order to bring these technologies and related products to the UK.\n\nPI works closely with other automation organisations to develop and enhance international standards that improve productivity while keeping energy consumption and waste to an absolute minimum. They manage and monitor the certification process for testing products and training installers, designers and engineers. \n\nServing an exceptionally wide range of industries, including energy management, pulp and paper, chemical, utilities, pharmaceutical, food and drink, and numerous others, PI’s technologies bring substantial benefits to an astounding number of companies. One example is Coca-Cola; since 2011, Coca-Cola has been using PROFIBUS DP to manage their entire production line in their Mannheim, Germany production plant, from the bottle washer, to filler, to labeller, and to packer.\n \nAnother example is General Electric; GE employs PROFINET in its power generation businesses to monitor and produce electricity for utilities and their customers around the world. Finally, Shell achieved cost savings of 50% during the installation of its Hamburg, Germany plant due to using PROFIBUS to minimise wiring and hardware. It currently blends 350,000 tons of oil per year using PROFIBUS PA.\n\nMany more examples of how PROFIBUS and PROFINET are being used to save energy, cost and other resources can be found on the PI website at: https://www.profibus.com/technology/case-studies/\n\nA particularly interesting innovation is PI’s PROFIenergy Profile, developed to help automation users minimise energy consumption, cut costs and comply with increasingly stringent ‘green’ obligations. Existing methods are often crude, expensive and hard to manage, such as switching off equipment manually or installing semi-automated shut-down systems. This is where PROFIenergy comes in; the Profile enables control devices, such as PLCs, to send commands to Energy Consuming Units (ECU) to signal pauses, like lunch breaks, holidays, random line stoppages or peak lead conditions. On receipt of PROFIenergy commands, the software ‘agents’ in the ECU firmware initiate pre-defined ‘sleep’ modes for the duration of the pause.\n\nConstantly looking for ways to benefit the industry, PI UK hosted a free-to-attend training opportunity in Manchester on June 26th this year, which paid close attention to Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The event addressed key practical issues arising from the use of digital communication technologies in automated manufacturing and process industry applications, covering key application areas such as control systems and energy management, pulp and paper, chemical, utilities, pharmaceutical, mechanical handling and logistics, robotics, automotive engineering, electrical and electronics assembly, packaging and printing. Focusing on the practical aspects of using PROFINET, PROFIBUS and IO-Link, from system design and safety considerations through to fault-finding and maintenance, it was an unmissable event which offered a valuable training opportunity.\n\nSome of the presentations on the day included PROFIBUS network design for process industries, the fundamental principles of good network design for PROFINET systems, industrial network commissioning and testing, PROFIBUS and PROFINET device configuration tools, and finally an explanation of the Industrial Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 and Big Data, and how PROFINET is placed as the ideal Industrial Fieldbus to fulfil these.\n\nIn addition to these presentations, the event also hosted an exhibition with live product demonstrations, providing an excellent opportunity for designers, production/system engineers, instrument technicians/engineers and C&I engineers who are involved in the design, operation and maintenance of modern automated factories and process plant. Exhibitors included Belcom Cables, a specialist supplier of industrial automation cables, HMS Industrial Networks who have an extensive portfolio which includes network gateways, wireless and cloud-based solutions, and Endress+Hauser, one of the first companies to supply both PROFIBUS DP/PA and PROFINET compliant field devices.\n\nPI UK has a busy calendar of exciting and valuable events, and if their seminar on 26th June is anything to go by, these are unmissable opportunities for an extensive range of companies. To ensure people don’t miss out on the next event, PI UK is encouraging people to register on their mailing list to be the first to be informed of future opportunities and seminars, via this link: http://eepurl.com/c8cFYf\n\nAs well as this, PI UK offers five different levels of membership to cover a wide range of requirements, and are encouraging companies and institutions to join the organisation as users of its technology. Depending on the level of membership selected, there is also free access to patented IP related to PI’s technology, which is of significant benefit to any company wishing to manufacture PROFIBUS, PROFINET or IO-LINK compatible products. PI offers a wealth of advantages for its members, including free access to all PROFIBUS, PROFINET and IO-Link documentation, discounts on training, participation in events and much more. For more information on becoming a member and its full range of benefits, head to this page: https://profibusgroup.com/membership/\n\nLooking to the future, PI is continuing to develop and deliver industrial standards that will help manufacturing and process industries meet and exceed their productivity and sustainability targets. Indeed, with over 80 million nodes installed worldwide, PI is a market leader in providing state of the art digital communications, expertly addressing all their customers’ needs – at plant level, in the Cloud or at the Edge.\n\nFor more information on their full range of services, head to their website or use the contact details below. \n\nT 020 8144 9597\nwww.profibus.com\nwww.profibusgroup.com",

      "DetailDescription" : "Wrightstyle, the advanced steel and aluminium glazing system company, recently completed three elevations of structurally-glazed curtain walling measuring over 50 metres in length as part of recent work on the eastern ticket hall of Crossrail’s Farringdon station.\n\nAs part of Crossrail’s Art Programme, British artist Simon Periton designed an artwork for the curtain walling featuring an intricate pattern that reflects the elaborate Victorian metalwork of the historic Smithfield Market directly opposite.\n\nDuring the day, the artwork will allow passengers to see inside to the coffered ceiling that echoes the Brutalist architecture of the nearby Barbican, whilst changing shadows will be cast across the interior space.\n\nIn the evening, the station lights will illuminate the design from inside, offering a dramatic new perspective to those on the nearby streets.\n\nWrightstyle is currently working on seven out of the 40 stations on the Elizabeth line, including Bond Street, Paddington, Farringdon, Liverpool Street, Whitechapel and Woolwich. The new Farringdon station is expected to serve 82,000 passengers every working day.\n\nSpecialist glass from Hero Glass was chosen for the project “which pushed the capabilities of normal glass design, but which also successfully fuses art and architecture in this remarkable building,” according to Lee Coates, UK director, Hero Glass. The artwork was created using a silk screen print process in Hero’s factory, which gave the visual result the artist was looking for.\n\n“Crossrail is the largest construction project in Europe and passenger safety is, of course, the paramount concern of the design team,” said Wrightstyle contracts manager, John Woodcock.\n\n“That’s the reason why our systems have been specified across several new stations on the Elizabeth Line. We have great experience in the transportation sector, and our systems have been subjected to international testing in Europe, the USA and Asia,” he said.\n\nT+44 (0)1380 722239\njane.embury@wrightstyle.co.uk\nwww.wrightstyle.co.uk\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Oaks Industrial Estate, Leicester, recently benefited from a much needed lift thanks to the collaboration between Season Masters Windows and Kestrel Aluminium Systems.\n\nThe project specification required the new windows to be thermally efficient to ensure that the upgrades resulted in the industrial units being economical for the occupants as well as creating a modern and clean look to the overall estate. Working to a strict schedule Season Master Windows needed to have fabricated and installed the replacement windows within eight weeks. \n\nKestrel Aluminium Systems supplied the complete product kit required to fabricate the windows. The decision was made to opt for the 60mm Window System to provide maximum thermal performance, and to meet the specification of being ‘top hung open out’ to enable natural ventilation. Trickle vents were also installed to ensure constant ventilation. \n\nSeason Master Windows was confident that it would be able to meet the time scale set as the delivery of material would be with them in full within two working weeks by Kestrel Aluminium Systems who pride themselves on their enviable service delivery turnaround times. By opting to use aluminium windows for the industrial estate it has resulted in a modern look being achieved with the added benefit of providing peace of mind for the owners and occupiers that the units are safe and secure.",

      "DetailDescription" : "Here at Sustainability Today, we like to recognise companies that go above and beyond, striving for brilliance and using innovative approaches to ensure continual growth with a focus on sustainability. This is why we are proud to announce that VINCI Facilities has been selected as our Facilities Management Company of the Year.\n\nVINCI Facilities is committed to providing outstanding customer service, embracing innovation and collaboration to ensure they are, and remain, the benchmark against which their competitors are measured. Complementing and enhancing their Facilities Management and Refurbishment/Building activities, VINCI offer an extensive range of energy and water management services across a wide range of customers and business sectors.\n\nVINCI Facilities is the trading name of VINCI Construction UK Limited, and is the £270 million UK facilities services organisation of the VINCI Group, a global facilities, concession and construction group. VINCI Construction UK traces its origins back to 1918, and over the past 100 years the addition of trusted names including Norwest Construction and Taylor Woodrow has widened the company’s capabilities, enabling them to integrate developing technologies and lead the way in burgeoning new industries. VINCI Facilities Energy and Water Management experts provide innovative yet practical services and solutions, which reduce energy, carbon, water, cost, and risk for their customers.\n\nAs specialists in the built environment, VINCI Facilities provides tailored solutions through both their Facilities Management and Building Solutions businesses. They are committed to delivering technical and organisational expertise, and provide their clients with a diverse range of facilities management, building maintenance, refurbishment, regeneration, and project management solutions designed to meet the challenges of modern organisations. They also offer a comprehensive range of Energy and Water Management services, which are tailored to their customer’s needs, including an embedded Energy and Water Manager, utilities procurement & bill validation, bureau services, and alternative energy solutions along with renewables and battery storage. \n\nAs a part of the wider VINCI group, they offer an unparalleled breadth and depth of technical expertise in the built environment, enabling them to deliver long-term sustainable value for their customers, shareholders, employees and partners, as well as society at large. They have successful partnerships with organisations of every size, from local authorities, schools, hospitals, social housing, and government departments, through to utilities, retail, manufacturing, rail and leisure. \n\nVINCI Facilities is proud to be benchmarked annually as leaders in the Sustainable FM Index, and demonstrate an integrated approach to sustainability; from strategy to operation.\n\nVINCI Facilities’ Energy & Water Management business has grown out of a desire to continue to provide exceptional services to their customers and to mitigate the growing influence of utilities and carbon in a modern business. Their innovative services and solutions continue to reduce energy, carbon, water, cost and risk for our customers.  \n\nVINCI Facilities Energy and Water Management services and activities are underpinned by an in-house Utilities Bureau, based in Manchester. The Bureau takes data from a customer’s portfolio to analyse utilities consumption, trends and alarms that may indicate performance issues, providing valuable information and insight. They can then take measures to rectify the problems, bringing about savings and avoiding excessive costs or, rectifying more acute issues, such as water leaks or exceeding electrical supply capacity. The Bureau also produces multiple levels of utilities reporting, including management summaries, PFI contractual performance, and operational reviews, turning raw data into information that can be acted upon to improve performance.\n\nThe Bureau is only one aspect of their service offering. A full range of services is available from strategy & direction through to ‘on-the-ground’ energy and water management, ensuring their customers have confidence that every requirement or challenge can be successfully met. Whether the requirement is a complex Investment Grade Audit, utilities procurement, operational support or simply advice on legislation, VINCI’s team pride themselves on always being available to support their customers’ needs and consistently delivering a quality service.\n\nA topical subject for 2019 is the Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) as Phase 2 of the scheme is now underway and eligible organisations must comply with the scheme by 5th December 2019. Phase 1 of ESOS, which closed in 2014/15, was challenging partly due to a lack of Lead Assessors. This caused last-minute panic, failed assessments, compliance delays, and even fines from the Environment Agency. VINCI Facilities Energy and Water Management are working with multiple customers to ensure those problems don’t reoccur for Phase 2 of ESOS.\n\nIt is clear that the VINCI name symbolises the very best in sustainable innovation, creativity and technological mastery. Through their One Team ethos, VINCI is committed to developing an open, transparent, trust-based partnership with their customers, stakeholders, and supply chain partners. Their vision is to be regarded by all their stakeholders as the leading and trusted expert in the responsible management, operation and adaptation of the built environment, with a mission to create and maintain great places to live and work, listening to what their customers need and providing innovative solutions that add value, delivered by excellent people who care.\n\nIf you would like to find out more information about VINCI Facilities’ excellent services, including Energy & Water Management, Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) or Utilities Bureau Services, head to their website or use the contact details below.\n\nT 0161 320 2900\ninfo@vincifacilities.co.uk\nESOS@vincifacilities.com\nwww.vincifacilities.com",

      "DetailDescription" : "Here at Tradex News we are extremely excited to announce that Mill Heat has been chosen for our highly esteemed Heating Company of the Month profile as a result of their innovative, stylish and technology driven heating.\n\nMill Heat was first set up back in 1992 by Cato Bryn. Based in Oslo, Norway, the family run business’ initial focus was on supplying BBQ and outdoor patio heating. However when Cato’s son identified a niche in the market for modern heating for the home, the company shifted focus and has since become renowned as a supplier of beautiful, minimalistic heaters. \n\nWith a passion for innovation, Mill Heat launched the ‘Mill’ brand in 2012, offering unique, Norwegian designs that utilise SMART technology. The heaters, available from the largest retailers among Nordic countries, proved highly successful, leading Mill Heat to then bring the Mill brand to the IFA fair in Berlin, 2015, and the International Home + Houseware show in Chicago, 2016, receiving heaps of praise. Mill soon exploded with popularity and today, their electric, portable and wall mounted heating can now be found in over 20 countries across Europe, Asia and North America. \n\nMill provide everything from Oil heaters to Glass Panel heaters, Wifi controlled heaters and much more. One of the places you can get your hands on Mill is through their exclusive UK distribution partner Benross Marketing. We spoke to Jon Brennan, from Benross Marketing, about what makes this brand stand out, to which he explained, “Most noticeable about Mill is the design. These heaters are designed in Oslo and are evidently Scandinavian; however it's not just about the looks. Quality, performance and ease of use are also key factors that separate us from other brands.\n\n“As an example, under test conditions, our Mill oil heaters can heat a room up to 29% faster than a 'normal' heater of exactly the same specification. Not only does this get the room to a comfortable level quicker, but it also saves the consumer money as the digital thermostat will switch the heater off sooner.”  \n\nMill Heat’s Panel heaters are also extremely sought after, coming in two styles: Steel and Glass. In addition to being IP rated, these heaters are fitted with a 3 pin plug, which takes just minutes to install, and they also exude the signature Scandi-style of Mill Heat that has made them so popular. Not only that, but these heaters can also be controlled through the intuitive Mill Heat App, whereby users can set up a schedule of when to use the heater. \n\nJon explained, “With the Mill Heat App, users can set up a 24/7 timer that sets the air temperature to their required level, and this can be overridden at any time from anywhere in the world. We will also be launching our WIFI connected portable heaters this autumn, which will be another huge progressive step for portable heating in the UK market. We are also soon to launch our new, highly anticipated outdoor patio heaters in the Scandinavian market.”\n\nCurrently undergoing a wave of expansion, with their hands in both European, US and Far East markets, Mill Heat are currently working to widen their reach and strengthen their distribution markets. \n\nIf you are interested in transforming your interiors with Mill’s stunning, sleek and advanced heaters, be sure to get in contact using the details below or feel free to check out their website. \n\nT 0151 448 1200\nwww.millheat.co.uk \n\n",

This issue is even more important when it comes to flooring materials, as safety concerns such as slip resistance should be paid close attention.\n\nIn commercial buildings, there will often be high levels of footfall, especially in reception areas, dining rooms and bathrooms, so you’ll need to select materials that are durable and resilient. However, in domestic buildings, you may want to focus more on the aesthetics, such as how the materials appear visually and how they add a sense of style to a room.\n\nA way you can meet both needs is to procure natural stone materials, and in particular, porcelain. The aesthetic benefits of porcelain are widely recognised, and it’s also incredibly hardwearing, easy to clean and has good anti-slip qualities even when it’s wet.\n\nAt Caledonian Stone, we have our own pendulum slip resistance testing equipment that ensures the products we recommend meet the correct standards in line with HSE Slip Resistance Guidelines. For example, our Logan porcelain meets these standards and is available in a range of different sizes and colours.

      "DetailDescription" : "Sustainability Today is proud to announce that Bollegraaf Recycling\nSolutions has been selected as our Recycling Solutions Company of the\nMonth, for its outstanding range of recycling technology which is helping\nto drive the green agenda.\n\nBollegraaf was established in 1961. After producing vertical balers, which\nbecame renowned for their high quality, Bollegraaf began developing its\ntechnology with sustainability in mind. The range quickly grew from\nvertical, via semi-automatic to its current fully automatic baler with a\npre-press flap. The concept quickly took hold, leading to Bollegraaf\ngrowing from a small Dutch business into a multinational company, and it is\nnow a global player in recycling and waste processing equipment.\n\n“We design and build high quality recycling solutions for any kind of\nwaste,” explained Leendert Rijneveld, Marketing Manager. “We work closely\nwith our customers to design a solution to best suit their needs, so\neverything is made bespoke for each individual company. We’re a well-known\nrecycling partner and have a proven track record across the world for\ndelivering high quality solutions. We always receive great feedback from\nour customers, who pass on their recommendations to others, so we have a\nloyal customer base and see a lot of organic growth thanks to this.”\n\nSince its inception nearly 60 years ago, Bollegraaf has expanded its\nproduct range significantly, and it now includes complete sorting\ninstallations and recycling products that are developed by the company’s in\nhouse team of designers and engineers. These leading solutions are ideal\nfor the processing of wastepaper, plastics and a vast range of commercial &\nindustrial and domestic waste.

      "DetailDescription" : "Giles Lillistone, Technical & Quality Manager at GreenBrook Electrical, talks about emergency lighting and the requirement for successful installation and testing…\n\nEvery building has a specific requirement for emergency lighting, the role of which is to take over from the normal lighting provision in the event of a power failure. Lighting requirements will vary within each building as rooms without the benefit of daylight must always have lighting provided. Similarly, if a building is occupied at night, there should be emergency lighting installed in all areas, including those lit naturally during the day.\n\nIt is now considered that emergency lighting is a primary factor in fire safety and should enable occupants to immediately locate fire-fighting equipment and alarms. Emergency lighting installations are examined as part of a building's overall fire precautions risk assessment.\n\nEmergency lighting is a general term and is subdivided into 'emergency escape lighting' and 'standby lighting'. Standby lighting is the part of emergency lighting that enables normal activities to continue in the event of failure of the normal mains supply.\n\nThe difference between these is that while emergency lighting forms part of the fire protection of a building, standby lighting does not.\n\nPositioning of emergency lighting\nEmergency escape lighting should illuminate the following:\nEach exit door - Where the exit route or final exit is not readily identifiable or familiar to the occupants, a sign should be used with a pictogram of the person moving towards the doorway, rather than just a lighting unit\nEscape routes\nIntersection of corridors\nOutside each final exit and on external escape routes\nEmergency escape signs\nStairways, ensuring each flight receives adequate light\nChanges in floor level\nWindowless rooms and toilet accommodation exceeding 8m² \nFire-fighting equipment\nFire alarm call points\nEquipment that would need to be shut down in an emergency or a high risk task area\nLifts\nAreas in premises greater than 60m²\n\nA sufficient overall level of light is required to allow all of the above items to be visible and usable - it is not necessary to provide individual luminaires for each item listed.\n\nMaintained or non-maintained?\nEmergency escape lighting can be both 'maintained', ie. on all the time continuing to operate in the event of a power failure, or 'non-maintained', a system that only operates when the normal lighting fails. These units are designed to operate for durations of greater than three hours after the mains power supply fails.\n\nNon-maintained operation is generally the most popular choice, being cheaper in terms of energy consumption and the life span of the fitting. However, in some premises where the luminaires are always 'on', ie. in maintained mode, such as theatres and cinemas, there is sometimes no choice in the matter.\n\nA disadvantage of non-maintained variants is that the condition of the lamp can only be established through regular testing; it's no good waiting for a power cut to discover it isn't working!\n\nEmergency luminaires are also available as signs; a typical example is the pictogram of the person moving through or towards a doorway, with a directional arrow. Others may use text, eg. 'Fire Exit'. These units are available in both maintained and non-maintained versions in a range of styles, from the simple box type through to the slimline hanging sign. Pictograms and pictograms with text should not be mixed in the same premises.\n\nMore options…\nThere are two main types of luminaire, the relevant standard for which is BS EN 60598-2-22: self-contained and centrally supplied.\n\nThe self-contained luminaire contains all the essential components (ie. battery, charger, control unit, lamp, diffuser, and any test or monitoring facility) for it to function as an independent emergency light. This is the most common form of emergency lighting and is typically supplied as a surface-mounted, rectangular bulkhead luminaire, although a wide range of self-contained luminaires are available.\n\nCentrally supplied luminaires, or 'slaves' because they cannot function independently, are defined by BS EN 60598-2-22 as follows: 'luminaire for maintained or non-maintained operation which is energised from a central emergency power system that is not contained within the luminaire'. Slave fittings contain the lamp and some of the control gear but the charger, battery, and often the changeover device are located remotely and provide the supply to a number of luminaires.\n\nIllumination\nThe degree of illumination required should be closely related to the nature of both the premises and its occupants, with special consideration required for care homes, hospitals, crowded venues like pubs, nightclubs, etc, and to whether the premises has overnight accommodation.\n\nIn areas of high risk (operating moving machinery or vehicles, a kitchen or chemical area) the maintained illuminance should not be >10% of the required maintained illuminance for the task. This will be subject to a minimum illuminance of 15lux. The minimum duration is the period for which the risk exists to people.\n\nAll emergency luminaries should meet the lumen output specified by the manufacturer to ensure any areas that need emergency lighting are well lit. Choosing illumination with features such as refractive optics that provide high and uniform light levels ensure clear vision.\n\nTesting\nLegislation clearly states the requirements of testing emergency lighting units. Regular checks ensure that all users have sufficient illumination in the event of an emergency.\n\nTesting should include:\nA daily visual check of any central controls if a centrally powered system with slave luminaires is installed\nA monthly function test by operating the test facility for a period sufficient to ensure that each emergency lamp illuminates\nAn annual full discharge test to ensure that the lamps are lit for the full discharge period (usually 3 hours) and that the batteries are recharging\n\nA typical test is using a key operated switch that is located either near the main fuse board or adjacent to relevant light switches. This is also known as a 'secret key' switch, as it is designed to allow testing of emergency lights while preventing non-authorised operation of the test switch.\n\nFollowing a full discharge test the batteries typically take 24 hours to re-charge. The premises should not be re-occupied until the lighting system is fully functioning.\n\nIt is best practice to keep a record of all tests in the safety/risk assessment logbook.\n\nWay-guidance equipment complements emergency escape lighting, especially for those occupants unfamiliar with the premises to help identify exit routes. This comprises photo-luminescent material, lines of LEDs, or strips of miniature incandescent lamps, forming a continuous marked escape route at floor level. These systems have proved particularly effective when people have to escape through smoke, and for partially-sighted people.\n\nLED emergency lighting\nWith increasing focus on energy saving, LED is becoming the popular choice for emergency luminaires. The lamps start up instantly giving an additional bonus against some other types of low energy lamps, plus LEDs are smaller so can be used in more stylish designs.\n\nNew emergency fittings come complete with an auto-testing feature which can be cost-effective and more reliable than manual testing. It's considered the best way to meet current testing regulations and reduces the burden of testing manually.\n\nEven though emergency lighting is a legal requirement, we can now choose a variety of styles from downlights to bulkheads to ensure the fitting is in keeping with its surroundings.\n\nGreenBrook offers a selection of twin spots, downlights, bulkheads, exit signs, recessed lights, and emergency gear trays with LED options.\n\nFor further information, please visit: www.greenbrook.co.uk\n",

      "DetailDescription" : "Over the past 14 years Lighting Controls Limited has established an enviable reputation for customer service and innovation within the lighting industry. An increasing rarity, Lighting Controls Ltd achieves all of its design and manufacture in house in Farnham, Surrey. This degree of control means that their design, service and R&D engineers understand their customers and the lighting control industry like no other company. Top quality components and the latest production techniques contributes in no small way to exceptional reliability and performance.\n\nWith lighting contributing 20% or more of an average building’s electricity consumption, innovative lighting control technology can lead to significant savings. With emergency lighting test procedures sometimes requiring days per month in a large facility when performed manually, their automation leads to major savings and provides more informative reporting options and goes a long way to eliminating human error.\n\nA History of Innovation\nThe most recent and probably the most innovative product to hit the lighting control industry is Lighting Controls Ltd’s new EcoLux Graphics Interface. This new software/server package uses a tablet, smart phone, PC or MAC, (in fact, any device with a browser), to control, programme or monitor a lighting control system. This enables lighting to be controlled or programmed from within that zone, so the user can see the impact of programme changes in real time. Users can be assigned with different levels of access so that, for instance, a tenant will have control access over their particular leased space whereas a landlord will have exclusive access to the control of public areas and stair wells etc., along with test procedure reports for the whole building (for which they may have legal liability).\n\nA high priority in designing this software-based system was the simplicity of the interface. Each area controlled by the EcoLUX Graphical Interface is represented graphically as a floor plan with visualisation of lighting status down to individual devices. The failure of any component, a ballast, for instance, is immediately apparent. The system also allows for remote inspection by Lighting Control Ltd’s engineering staff should any problem arise within the system; often eliminating costly call-out charges.\n\nAnother cost and time saving innovation from Lighting Controls Ltd. is the elimination of CAT A commissioning costs when using their new Area Controller. The new test features incorporated in the Controller allows a lighting control network to be checked before commissioning with all DALI strings being tested. In other words, the integrity of the installation can be checked when the network wiring is completed, and the lighting system fully working. With this new and innovative protocol, the building’s lighting is functional before a CAT B fit out but without the cost of commissioning.\n\nThe renovation of older buildings always presents challenges. Lighting Controls Ltd. has introduced a DALI Switch Interface to help meet the challenge of interfacing architectural switches into the DALI network.
