Graves1, Nigel Monk2* Corresponding author \u2013 s.mcmaster@pillarhouse.co.uk1 Functional Materials and Chemistry Research Group, Research Centre for\nManufacturing and Materials, Institute of Clean Growth and Future Mobility,\nCoventry University, Priory Street, Coventry CV1 5FB, U.K.2 Pillarhouse International Ltd., Rodney Way, Chelmsford, CM1 3BY, U.K.Introduction\nSelective soldering utilises a nozzle to apply solder to components on the\nunderside of printed circuit boards (PCBs). This nozzle can be moved to\neither perform dips (depositing solder to a single component) or draws\n(applying solder to several components in a single movement). The selective\nsoldering methodology thereby allows the process to be tailored to specific\njoints and allows multiple nozzle types to be used if required on the\ncircuit board.Key attributes of nozzles\nTo ensure that controlled application of the solder is maintained, the\nsolder must wet to the nozzle. Wettability is the study of the adhesion of\nliquids to solids due to the interaction between the surface energy of the\nsolid and the surface tension of the liquid. The most common method of\nmeasuring wettability is determining the contact angle of a sessile\ndroplet.When in contact with a solid, a liquid droplet will deform and spread out.\nThe amount of spreading and the angle of the interface between the liquid\nand solid is determined by the surface tension of the liquid and the\nsurface energy of the solid. Figure 1 demonstrates scenarios with various\nlevels of wetting. When the surface energy of the solid is greater than the\nsurface tension of the liquid, the droplet will have a lower contact angle.\nFigure 1(a) and (b) are an example of this.Figure 1. Examples of different contact angles between a droplet (stripped\nred) and solid (blue): (a) Contact angle of 0\u00b0 demonstrating perfect\nwetting. (b) Contact angle less than 90\u00b0for a wetting surface. (c) Contact\nangle greater than 90\u00b0 hydrophobic surface. By Idris.abk - Own work, CC BY-\nSA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=97191171For the wetting of the solder to the tip of the nozzle maintains a stable\nradial wave and achieves control during the soldering process by\nmaintaining a stable dome shape to deposit solder. Figure 2 shows a well\nwetted nozzle wherein the solder is adhered to the entire outer surface of\nthe nozzle. This allows for good control during the selective soldering\nprocess. The static wettability for this nozzle would be akin to Figure 1\n(a) or (b).Figure 2. A wetted nozzle.In the case of a material that solder does not readily wet to, the solder\nwill maintain a single stream as shown in Figure 3. The static wettability\nof this nozzle would produce a large contact angle such as in Figure 1 (c).Figure 3. A non-wetting nozzle.To achieve wetting between liquid solder and a nozzle, there must be a\nclean interface. Flux is used to remove oxides and generate/maintain this\nclean interface before and during operation. After cleaning, a chemical\nreaction between the solder and nozzle determines the extent of the wetting\nbut this interaction also causes wear of the nozzle.Therefore, a good nozzle must have good wettability to solder ensuring that\ncontrol can be maintained during the selective soldering process in\naddition to a balance between the wear and wetting.The need for development\nThe new nozzle will reduce operation and maintenance costs for\nmanufacturers by reducing the number of nozzles required overall and\nreducing downtime caused by nozzle failure. Improving the wettability of\nnozzles will allow for more challenging joints to be tackled using the\nselective method. This project has been undertaken due to customer requests\nto increase nozzle lifetime and reduce the maintenance required.This research project, part funded by Innovate UK and Pillarhouse\nInternational Ltd. is partnered with Coventry University through a\nknowledge transfer partnership scheme. The new AP Master Nozzle will be\navailable in June of 2023.T +44 (0)1245 491333\nsales@pillarhouse.co.uk\nwww.pillarhouse.co.uk\n",

            "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Sustainability Today, we are proud to announce that ENOTEC GmbH is our Gas Analysis Solution Company of the Month.ENOTEC GmbH is a leading player in the process gas analysis technology, focussed primarily on the development, production and sale of In-Situ gas analysers and interconnected equipment for process control and emission monitoring applications. The analysers are perfectly suited for applications that involve incineration and combustion processes.Established 1980 by Fred Gumprecht in Marienheide near Cologne, Germany, ENOTEC expanded exponentially in product development and production. With subsidiaries in UK, USA and Belarus, the company continues to offer global expertise, with localised, regional support.Among many others, the target industries include coal, gas and oil-fired power plants, refineries, chemical and petrochemical plants, cement and steel plants, refuse, biomass and sludge incinerators, paper/pulp manufactories, waste heat boilers, drying processes and marine engines. The precision-driven ENOTEC products are designed to operate efficiently in high flue gas temperatures and high dust load environments, as well as corrosive or reducing atmospheres.ENOTEC\u2019s compliancy to the quality management system ISO 9001 ensures that the gas-sensing analysers provide reliable, accurate values. Furthermore, a SIL 2 (1oo1 selection) functional safety certificate is available for the O2 sensor. On request and under certain conditions, a QAL1 certification can be issued for O2 monitoring as part of a CEMS.We caught up with Angie Ni\u00f1o, Digital Marketing Manager, to find out more about ENOTEC\u2019s gas analysers, \u201cThe OXITEC\u00ae 5000 can measure the excess O2 directly after a combustion process to permanently control the air-fuel ratio. ENOTEC develops and produces their own zirconia based O2 sensors, which are particularly robust, remain gas-tight due to a special soldering technique and have an average life expectancy of 7 to 8 years in typical combustion-related applications.\u201dMoreover, ENOTEC\u2019s range of EX-probes and electrical control units permits measurements in designated explosion areas. Besides the European ATEX certification for zones 1/2, the analysers are certified according to the international IECEx regulations, which enables the worldwide use of the ENOTEC systems.For example, the explosion-prove COMTEC 6000 GasEx probe embodies an additional COe sensor (COe = sum of all combustible gas components such as CO. H2, CxHy, etc.). Excess O2 and COe levels can be adjusted down to a minimum, enabling optimal fuel efficiency. The precise combined In-Situ measurement allows immediate reaction to changes in the flue gas composition, which is ideal for a safe operation, especially in refineries.Arising from the COMTEC set-up, ENOTEC has developed the SILOTEC, a system to monitor the inertisation of silos (e.g. coal storage) and early detection of smouldering fires.Recently ENOTEC also displayed its CEMTEC rotary kiln extraction probe at the 2023 Global CemProducer Conference and Expo in Munich, Germany. Following the exhibition, trade delegates visited the refurbished Burglengenfeld Heidelberg Cement plant, to see the sophisticated state-of-the-art CEMTEC technology in action. It is designed for extreme harsh process conditions (temperatures up to 1400\u00b0C and dust loads up to 2000g/m\u00b3), having an availability of more than 95%.ENOTEC has been a global leader of precision-driven process gas analysers for over 40 years and as Angie Ni\u00f1o comments, \u201cDue to the constantly evolving market for emissions and process analysers, ENOTEC is decidedly committed to stay at the forefront of this evolution by strongly investing in research and development for future innovation.\u201dFor more information, see the UK Sales office details below:T +44 (0)844 247 0102enotec.uk@enotec.comwww.enotec.com",
