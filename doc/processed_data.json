        "DetailDescription": "In this issue of Products and Services Review we are proud to announce that we have selected Botanica International Ltd as our Natural Products Provider of the Month.Established in 2005 by Sean Cooney, the company is based in Warrenpoint in Co.Down, and the original inspiration was to cater for the growing awareness of natural products in society, as well as to develop the wonders of Nature\u2019s herbal energy. Botanica International Ltd has developed a multi-award winning product range combining amazing natural ingredients that have proven beneficial properties. All products can be used on both humans and animals, and as Sean stated, \u201cRespect for nature is at the heart of everything that we do at Botanica.\u201dThis wide range of products includes natural herb creams, washes and sprays, and the products are made using a range of powerful plants provided by nature. Sean commented, \u201cOur products are carefully prepared using combinations of herbs and soothing natural oils. We use Aloe Vera, Comfrey, Oil of Lavender and Tea Tree oil, as well as Need Oil and even Cedar Wood, all of which have proven results for many skin conditions. These ingredients are contained in a specially formulated cream base with moisturising agents.\u201dFrom the outset Botanica International Ltd believed that there is a different and better way to promote healthy balanced skin alongside nature, therefore, all its products are made from natural ingredients that are clinically tested to be safe and gentle on all skin types. There are no harmful chemicals, toxic ingredients or artificial colourants, as from the outset, the company found that nature provided the best solutions for these problems.Over the past 15 years, Botanica International Ltd have developed a customer base across the world, enabling its products to be delivered worldwide. It is the only company in the western world selling herbal products to China and has \u2018No.1 in the world\u2019 on the Botanica packaging in China.The company has also won a long list of awards for its products, and is especially proud to have been awarded the Royal Warrant by appointment of Her Majesty the Queen. Royal Warrants are granted to companies or people who have regularly supplied goods or services to either the Queen or the Prince of Wales. Sean commented, \u201cThe Royal Warrant is a great honour, as it is a recognition of our long-term focus on quality and excellence in the manufacture of natural herbal products.\u201dBotanica International Ltd has recently updated the fly spray which it produces. Botanica\u2019s Fly Repellent is an all-natural spray with a unique formula and can be used on all animals, keeping them protected for longer. This new further improved formulation can be sprayed directly onto the skin and can be used all year round boasting100% natural properties.The company is very proud of the success of its products, but this success has not been achieved by chance. Sean stated, \u201cWe only send out proven products that actually work, we do not allow second rate products to bear the name Botanica. With Botanica\u2019s sprays, creams and washes you are guaranteed the best results as we succeed where others have failed!\u201dFor more information:T 028417 38151enquiries@botanica.ie www.botanica.ie",
